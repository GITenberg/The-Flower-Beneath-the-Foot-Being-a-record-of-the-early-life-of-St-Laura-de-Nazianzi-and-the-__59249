<h2 id="I">I</h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">Neither</span> her Gaudiness the Mistress
of the Robes, or her Dreaminess the
Queen were feeling quite themselves.
In the Palace all was speculation. Would
they be able to attend the <i>F&ecirc;tes</i> in honour
of King Jotifa, and Queen Thleeanouhee
of the Land of Dates?&mdash;Court opinion
seemed largely divided. Countess Medusa
Rappa, a woman easily disturbable, was
prepared to wager what the Countess of
Tolga “liked” (she knew), that another
week would find the Court shivering beneath
the vaulted domes of the Summer-Palace.</p>

<p>“I fear I’ve no time (or desire) now,
Medusa,” the Countess answered, moving
towards the Royal apartments, “for
making bets,” though turning before the
ante-room door she nodded: “Done!”</p>

<p>She found her sovereign supine on a
couch piled with long Tunisian cushions,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
while a maid of honour sat reading to her
aloud :</p>

<p>“<i>Live with an aim, and let that aim be
high!</i>” the girl was saying as the Countess
approached.</p>

<p>“Is that you, Violet?” her Dreaminess
enquired without looking round.</p>

<p>“How is your condition, Madam?” the
Countess anxiously murmured.</p>

<p>“Tell me, do, of a place that soothes and
lulls one&mdash;&mdash;?”</p>

<p>The Countess of Tolga considered.</p>

<p>“Paris,” she hazarded.</p>

<p>“Ah! Impossible.”</p>

<p>“The Summer-Palace, then,” the
Countess ejaculated, examining her long
slender fingers that were like the tendrils
of a plant.</p>

<p>“Dr Cuncliffe Babcock flatly forbids
it,” the Royal woman declared, starting
slightly at the sound of a gun: “That
must be <i>the Dates</i>!” she said. And in
effect, a vague reverberation, as of individuals
cheering, resounded fitfully from
afar. “Give me my diamond anemones,”
the Queen commanded, and motioning to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
her Maid: “Pray conclude, mademoiselle,
those lofty lines.”</p>

<p>With a slight sigh, the lectress took up
the posture of a Dying Intellectual.</p>

<p>“<i>Live with an aim, and let that aim
be high!</i>” she reiterated in tones tinged
perceptibly with emotion.</p>

<p>“But not <i>too</i> high, remember, Mademoiselle
de Nazianzi....”</p>

<p>There was a short pause. And then&mdash;</p>

<p>“Ah Madam! What a dearest he is!”</p>

<p>“I think you forget yourself,” the Queen
murmured with a quelling glance. “You
had better withdraw.”</p>

<p>“He has such strength! One could
niche an idol in his dear, dinted chin.”</p>

<p>“Enough!”</p>

<p>And a moment later, the enflamed girl
left the room warbling softly: <i>Depuis le
Jour</i>.</p>

<p>“Holy Virgin,” the Countess said, addressing
herself to the ceiling. “Should
his Weariness, the Prince, yield himself to
this caprice....”</p>

<p>The Queen shifted a diamond bangle
from one of her arms to the other.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span></p>

<p>“She reads at such a pace,” she complained,
“and when I asked her <i>where</i> she
had learnt to read so quickly, she replied
‘On the screens at Cinemas.’”</p>

<p>“I do not consider her at all distinguished,”
the Countess commented turning
her eyes away towards the room.</p>

<p>It was a carved-ceiled, and rather lofty
room, connected by tall glass doors with
other rooms beyond. Peering into one of
these the Countess could see reflected the
“throne,” and a little piece of broken
Chippendale brought from England, that
served as a stand for a telephone, wrought
in ormolu and rock-crystal, which the sun’s
rays at present were causing to emit a
thousand playful sparks. Tapestry panels
depicting the Loves of <i>Mejnoun and Leileh</i>
half concealed the silver <i>bois&egrave;ries</i> of the
walls, while far down the room, across old
rugs from Chirvan that were a marvellous
wonder, showed fortuitous jardini&egrave;res, filled
with every flowering-kind of plant. Between
the windows were canopied recesses,
denuded of their statues by the Queen’s
desire, “in order that they might appear
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
suggestive,” while through the windows
themselves, the Countess could catch across
the fore-court of the castle, a panorama of
the town below, with the State Theatre
and the Garrisons, and the Houses of Parliament,
and the Hospital, and the low white
dome, crowned by turquoise-tinted tiles of
the Cathedral, which was known to all
churchgoers as <i>the Blue Jesus</i>.</p>

<p>“It would be a fatal connexion,” the
Queen continued, “and it must never,
never be!”</p>

<p>By way of response the Countess exchanged
with her sovereign a glance that
was known in Court circles as her <i>tortured-animal</i>
look: “Their Oriental majesties,”
she observed, “to judge from the din, appear
to have already endeared themselves
with the mob!”</p>

<p>The Queen stirred slightly amid her
cushions.</p>

<p>“For the aggrandisement of the country’s
trade, an alliance with Dateland is by no
means to be depreciated,” she replied,
closing her eyes as though in some way or
other this bullion to the State would allow
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
her to gratify her own wildest whims, the
dearest, perhaps, of which was to form a
party to excavate (for objects of art)
among the ruins of Chedorlahomor, a
<i>faubourg</i> of Sodom.</p>

<p>“Am I right, Madam, in assuming it’s
Bananas?...” the Countess queried.</p>

<p>But at that moment the door opened,
and his Weariness the Prince entered the
room in all his tinted Orders.</p>

<p>Handsome to tears, his face, even as a
child had lacked innocence. His was of
that <i>magnolia</i> order of colouring, set off
by pleasantly untamed eyes, and teeth like
flawless pearls.</p>

<p>“You’ve seen them? What are they
like.... Tell Mother, darling?” the
Queen exclaimed.</p>

<p>“They’re merely dreadful,” his Weariness,
who had been to the railway-station to
welcome the Royal travellers, murmured
in a voice extinct with boredom.</p>

<p>“They’re in European dress, dear?”
his mother questioned.</p>

<p>“The King had on a frock coat and a
cap....”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span></p>

<p>“And she?”</p>

<p>“A tartan-skirt, and checked wool-stockings.”</p>

<p>“She has great individuality, so I hear,
marm,” the Countess ventured.</p>

<p>“Individuality be &mdash;&mdash;! No one can
doubt she’s a terrible woman.”</p>

<p>The Queen gently groaned.</p>

<p>“I see life to-day,” she declared, “in
the colour of mould.”</p>

<p>The Prince protruded a shade the purple
violet of his tongue.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s depressing,” he said, “for us
all, with the Castle full of blacks.”</p>

<p>“That is the least of my worries,” the
Queen observed. “Oh, Yousef, Yousef,”
she added, “do you wish to break my
heart?”</p>

<p>The young man protruded some few
degrees further his tongue.</p>

<p>“I gather you’re alluding to Laura!”
he remarked.</p>

<p>“But what can you <i>see</i> in her?” his
mother mourned.</p>

<p>“She suits my feelings,” the Prince
simply said.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span></p>

<p>“Peuh!”</p>

<p>“She meets my needs.”</p>

<p>“She’s so housemaid.... I hardly
know...!” the Queen raised beautiful
hands bewildered.</p>

<p>“Tr&egrave;s gutter, ma’am,” the Countess murmured
dropping her voice to a half-whisper.</p>

<p>“She saves us from <i>clich&eacute;</i>,” the Prince
indignantly said.</p>

<p>“She saves us from nothing,” his mother
returned. “Oh, Yousef, Yousef. And
what <i>cern&eacute;</i> eyes, my son. I suppose you
were gambling all night at the Ch&acirc;teau
des Fleurs?”</p>

<p>“Just hark to the crowds!” the Prince
evasively said. And never too weary to
receive an ovation, he skipped across the
room towards the nearest window, where
he began blowing kisses to the throng.</p>

<p>“Give them the Smile Extending,
darling,” his mother beseeched.</p>

<p>“Won’t you rise and place your arm
about him, Madam,” the Countess suggested.</p>

<p>“I’m not feeling at all up to the mark,”
her Dreaminess demurred, passing her
fingers over her hair.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span></p>

<p>“There is sunshine, ma’am ... and you
have your <i>anemones</i> on ...” the Countess
cajoled, “and to please the people, you
ought indeed to squeeze him.” And she
was begging and persuading the Queen to
rise, as the King entered the room preceded
by a shapely page (of sixteen) with cheeks
fresher than milk.</p>

<p>“Go to the window, Willie,” the Queen
exhorted her Consort fixing an eye on the
last trouser button that adorned his long,
straggling legs.</p>

<p>The King, who had the air of a tired
pastry-cook, sat down.</p>

<p>“We feel,” he said, “to-day, we’ve had
our fill of stares!”</p>

<p>“One little bow, Willie,” the Queen
entreated, “that wouldn’t kill you.”</p>

<p>“We’d give perfect worlds,” the King
went on, “to go, by Ourselves, to
bed.”</p>

<p>“Get rid of the noise for me. <i>Quiet
them.</i> Or I’ll be too ill,” the Queen declared,
“to leave my room to-night!”</p>

<p>“Should I summon Whisky, Marm?”
the Countess asked, but before there was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
time to reply the Court physician, Dr
Cuncliffe Babcock was announced.</p>

<p>“I feel I’ve had a relapse, Doctor,” her
Dreaminess declared.</p>

<p>Dr Babcock beamed: he had one blind
eye&mdash;though this did not prevent him at
all from seeing all that was going on with
the other.</p>

<p>“Leave it to me, Madam,” he assured,
“and I shall pick you up in <i>no</i> time!”</p>

<p>“Not Johnnie, doctor?” the Queen
murmured with a grimace. For a glass
of <i>Johnnie Walker</i> at bed-time was the
great doctor’s favourite receipt.</p>

<p>“No; something a little stronger, I
think.”</p>

<p>“We need expert attention, too,” the
King intervened.</p>

<p>“You certainly are somewhat pale,
sir.”</p>

<p>“Whenever I go out,” the King complained,
“I get an impression of raised
hats.”</p>

<p>It was seldom King William of Pisuerga
spoke in the singular tense, and Doctor
Babcock looked perturbed.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span></p>

<p>“Raised hats, sir?” he murmured in
impressive tones.</p>

<p>“Nude heads, doctor.”</p>

<p>The Queen commenced to fidget. She
disliked that the King should appear more
interesting than herself.</p>

<p>“These earrings tire me,” she said,
“take them out.”</p>

<p>But the Prince, who seemed to be
thoroughly enjoying the success of his
appearance with the crowd, had already
begun tossing the contents of the flower
vases into the street.</p>

<p>“Willie ... prevent him! Yousef ...
I forbid you!” her Dreaminess faintly
shrieked. And to stay her son’s despoiling
hand she skimmed towards him, when the
populace catching sight of her, redoubled
their cheers.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Mademoiselle de Nazianzi had
regained again her composure. A niece
of her Gaudiness the Mistress of the Robes
(the Duchess of Cavaljos), her recent d&eacute;but
at Court, had been made under the brightest
conceivable of conditions.</p>

<p>Laura Lita Carmen Etoile de Nazianzi
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
was more piquant perhaps than pretty.
A dozen tiny moles were scattered about
her face, while on either side of her delicate
nose, a large grey eye surveyed the world
with a pensive critical glance.</p>

<p>“Scenes like that make one sob with
laughter,” she reflected, turning into the
corridor where two of the Maids of Honour,
like strutting idols, were passing up and
down.</p>

<p>“Is she really very ill? Is she <i>really</i>
dying?” they breathlessly enquired.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle de Nazianzi disengaged
herself from their solicitously entwining
arms.</p>

<p>“She is not!” she answered, in a voice
full of eloquent inflections.</p>

<p>But beguiled by the sound of marching
feet, one of the girls had darted forward
towards a window.</p>

<p>“Oh Blanche, Blanche, Blanchie love!”
she exclaimed, “I could dance to the click
of your brother’s spurs.”</p>

<p>“You’d not be the first to, dear darling!”
Mademoiselle de Lamb&egrave;se replied, adjusting
her short shock of hair before a glass.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span></p>

<p>Mademoiselle de Lamb&egrave;se believed herself
to be a very valuable piece of goods,
and seemed to think she had only to smile
to stir up an Ocean of passion.</p>

<p>“Poor Ann-Jules,” she said: “I fear
he’s in the clutches of that awful woman.”</p>

<p>“Kalpurnia?”</p>

<p>“Every night he’s at the Opera.”</p>

<p>“I hear she wears the costume of a shoe-black
in the new ballet,” Mademoiselle de
Nazianzi said, “and is too strangely
extraordinary!”</p>

<p>“Have you decided, Rara,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> yet, what
you’ll wear for the ball?”</p>

<p>“A black gown and three blue flowers
on my tummy.”</p>

<p>“After a Shrimp-tea with the Archduchess,
I feel I <i>want</i> no dinner,” Mademoiselle
Olga Blumenghast, a girl with
slightly hunched shoulders said, returning
from the window.</p>

<p>“Oh? Had she a party?”</p>

<p>“A cur&eacute; or two, and the Countess
Yvorra.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span></p>

<p>“Her black bordered envelopes make
one shiver!”</p>

<p>“I thought I should have died it was
so dull,” Mademoiselle Olga Blumenghast
averred, standing aside to allow his Lankiness,
Prince Olaf (a little boy wracked by
all the troubles of Spring), and Mrs Montgomery,
the Royal Governess, to pass.
They had been out evidently among the
crowd, and both were laughing heartily at
the asides they had overheard.</p>

<p>“’Ow can you be so frivolous, your
royal ’ighness?” Mrs Montgomery was
expostulating: “for shame, wicked boy!
For shame!” And her cheery British
laugh echoed gaily down the corridors.</p>

<p>“Well <i>I</i> took tea at the Ritz,” Mademoiselle
de Lamb&egrave;se related.</p>

<p>“Anybody?”</p>

<p>“Quite a few!”</p>

<p>“There’s a rumour that Prince Yousef
is entertaining there to-night.”</p>

<p>Mademoiselle Blumenghast tittered.</p>

<p>“Did you hear what he called the
lanterns for the <i>F&ecirc;te</i>?” she asked.</p>

<p>“No.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span></p>

<p>“A lot of ‘bloody bladders’!”</p>

<p>“What, what a dearest,” Mademoiselle
de Nazianzi sighed beneath her breath.
And all along the almost countless
corridors as far as her bedroom door, she
repeated again and again: “What, <i>what</i> a
dearest!”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span></p>

<h2 id="II">II</h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">Beneath</span> a wide golden ceiling
people were dancing. A capricious
concert waltz, drowsy, intricate,
caressing, reached fitfully the supper-room,
where a few privileged guests were already
assembled to meet King Jotifa and Queen
Thleeanouhee of the Land of Dates.</p>

<p>It was one of the regulations of the
Court, that those commanded to the King’s
board, should assemble some few minutes
earlier than the Sovereigns themselves,
and the guests at present were mostly
leaning stiffly upon their chair-backs, staring
vacuously at the olives and salted
almonds upon the table-cloth before them.
Several of the ladies indeed had taken
the liberty to seat themselves, and were
beguiling the time by studying the menu or
disarranging the smilax, while one dame
went as far as to take, and even to nibble,
a salted almond. A conversation of a non-private
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
kind (carried on between the thin,
authoritative legs of a Court Chamberlain)
by Countess Medusa Rappa and the English
Ambassadress, was being listened to by some
with mingled signs of interest.</p>

<p>“Ah! How clever Shakespere!” the
Countess was saying: “How gorgeous!
How glowing! I once knew a speech from
‘Julia Sees Her!...’ perhaps his greatest
<i>œuvre</i> of all. Yes! ‘Julia <i>Sees</i> Her’ is
what I like best of that great, great master.”</p>

<p>The English Ambassadress plied her
fan.</p>

<p>“Friends, Comrades, Countrymen,” she
murmured, “I used to know it myself!”</p>

<p>But the lady nibbling almonds was
exciting a certain amount of comment.
This was the Duchess of Varna, voted by
many to be one of the handsomest women
of the Court. Living in economical obscurity
nearly half the year round, her
appearances at the palace were becoming
more and more infrequent.</p>

<p>“I knew the Varnas were very hard up,
but I did not know they were <i>starving</i>,”
the Countess Yvorra, a woman with a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
would-be indulgent face, that was something
less hard than rock, remarked to her
neighbour the Count of Tolga, and dropping
her glance from the Count’s weak chin she
threw a fleeting smile towards his wife,
who was looking “Eastern” swathed in
the skin of a blue panther.</p>

<p>“Yes, their affairs it seems are almost
desperate,” the Count returned, directing
his gaze towards the Duchess.</p>

<p>Well-favoured beyond measure she
certainly was, with her immense placid
eyes, and bundles of loose, blonde hair.
She had a gown the green of Nile water,
that enhanced to perfection the swan-like
fairness of her throat and arms.</p>

<p>“I’m thinking of building myself a Villa
in the Land of Dates!” she was confiding
to the British Ambassador, who was standing
beside her on her right: “Ah, yes!
I shall end my days in a country strewn
with flowers.”</p>

<p>“You would find it I should say too hot,
Duchess.”</p>

<p>“My soul has need of the sun, Sir Somebody!”
the Duchess replied, opening with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
equanimity a great black ostrich fan, and
smiling up at him through the sticks.</p>

<p>Sir Somebody Something was a person
whose nationality was written all over him.
Nevertheless, he had despite a bluff, and
somewhat rugged manner, a certain degree
of feminine sensitiveness, and any reference
to the <i>soul</i> at all (outside the Embassy
Chapel), invariably made him fidget.</p>

<p>“In moderation, Duchess,” he murmured,
fixing his eyes upon the golden
head of a champagne bottle.</p>

<p>“They say it is a land of love!” the
Duchess related, raising indolently an
almond to her sinuously-chiselled lips.</p>

<p>“And even, so it’s said, too,” his Excellency
returned: “of licence!” when
just at this turn of things the Royal cort&egrave;ge
entered the supper-room, to the exhilarating
strains of King Goahead’s War-March.</p>

<p>Those who had witnessed the arrival of
King Jotifa and his Queen earlier in the
afternoon, were amazed at the alteration
of their aspect now. Both had discarded
their European attire for the loosely-flowing
vestments of their native land, and for a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
brief while there was some slight confusion
among those present as to which was the
gentleman, or which the lady of the two.
The king’s beard long and blonde, should
have determined the matter outright, but
on the other hand the Queen’s necklet of
reeds and plumes was so very misleading....
Nobody in Pisuerga, had seen anything
to compare to it before. “Marvellous,
though terrifying,” the Court passed
verdict.</p>

<p>Attended by their various suites, the
royal party gained their places amid the
usual manifestation of loyal respect.</p>

<p>But one of the Royal ladies as it soon
became evident was not yet come.</p>

<p>“Where’s Lizzie, Lois?” King William
asked, riveting the Archduchess’ empty
chair.</p>

<p>“We’d better begin without her, Willie,”
the Queen exclaimed, “you know she
never minds.”</p>

<p>And hardly had the company seated
themselves when, dogged by a lady-in-waiting
and a maid-of-honour, the Archduchess
Elizabeth of Pisuerga rustled in.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span></p>

<p>Very old and very bent, and (even) very
beautiful, she was looking as the Grammar-books
say, ‘meet’ to be robbed, beneath
a formidable tiara, and a dozen long strands
of pearls.</p>

<p>“Forgive me Willie,” she murmured,
with a little high shrill tinkling laugh:
“but it was so fine, that after tea I, and
a Lady, went paddling in the Basin of the
Nymphs.”</p>

<p>“How was the water?” the King
enquired.</p>

<p>The Archduchess repressed a sneeze:
“Fresh,” she replied, “but not too....”</p>

<p>“After sunset, beware dear Aunt, of
chills.”</p>

<p>“But for a frog, I believe nothing would
have got me out!” the august lady confessed
as she fluttered bird-like to her chair.</p>

<p>Forbidden in youth by parents and
tutors alike the joys of paddling under
pain of chastisement, the Archduchess
Elizabeth appeared to find a zest in doing
so now. Attended by a chosen lady-in-waiting
(as a rule the dowager Marchioness
of Lallah Miranda) she liked to slip off to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
one of the numerous basins or natural
grottos in the castle gardens, where she
would pass whole hours in wading blissfully
about. Whilst paddling, it was her wont
to run over those refrains from the vaudevilles
and operas (with their many shakes
and rippling <i>cadenzi</i>), in favour in her day,
interspersed at intervals by such cries as:
“Pull up your skirt, Marquise, it’s dragging
a little my friend below the knees ...” or,
“A shark, a shark!” which was her way
of designating anything that had fins, from
a carp to a minnow.</p>

<p>“I fear our Archduchess has contracted
a slight catarrh,” the Mistress of the Robes,
a woman like a sleepy cow, observed,
addressing herself to the Duke of Varna
upon her left.</p>

<p>“Unless she is more careful, she’ll go
paddling once too often,” the Duke replied,
contemplating with interest, above the
moonlight-coloured daffodils upon the table
board, one of the button-nosed belles of
Queen Thleeanouhee’s suite. The young
creature, referred to cryptically among the
subordinates of the Castle, as ‘Tropical
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
Molly,’ was finding fault already it seemed
with the food.</p>

<p>“Take it away,” she was protesting in
animated tones: “I’d as soon touch a
foot-squashed mango!”</p>

<p>“No <i>mayonnaise</i>, miss?” a court-official
asked, dropping his face prevailingly to
within an inch of her own.</p>

<p>“Take it right away.... And if you
should <i>dare</i> sir! to come any closer...!”</p>

<p>The Mistress of the Robes fingered nervously
the various Orders of Merit on her
sumptuous bosom.</p>

<p>“I trust there will be no contretemps,”
she murmured, glancing uneasily towards
the Queen of the Land of Dates, who seemed
to be lost in admiration of the Royal dinner-service
of scarlet plates, that looked like
pools of blood upon the cloth.</p>

<p>“What pleases me in your land,” she
was expansively telling her host, “is less
your food, than the china you serve it on;
for with us you know there’s none. And
now,” she added, marvellously wafting a
fork, “I’m for ever spoilt for shells.”</p>

<p>King William was incredulous.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span></p>

<p>“With you no china?” he gasped.</p>

<p>“None, Sir, none!”</p>

<p>“I could not be more astonished,” the
king declared, “if you told me there were
fleas at the Ritz,” a part of which assertion
Lady Something, who was blandly listening,
imperfectly chanced to hear.</p>

<p>“Who would credit it!” she breathed,
turning to an attach&eacute;, a young man all
white and pensieroso, at her elbow.</p>

<p>“Credit what?”</p>

<p>“Did you not hear what the dear king
said!”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“It’s almost <i>too</i> appalling ...” Lady
Something replied, passing a small, nerveless
hand across her brow.</p>

<p>“Won’t you tell me though,” the young
man murmured gently, with his nose in his
plate.</p>

<p>Lady Something raised a glass of frozen
lemonade to her lips.</p>

<p>“Fleas,” she murmured, “have been
found at the Ritz.”</p>

<p>“.............! .............? .......! ..... !!!”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span></p>

<p>“Oh and <i>poor</i> Lady Bertha! And poor
good old Mrs Hunter!” And Lady Something
looked away in the direction of Sir
Somebody, as though anxious to catch
his eye.</p>

<p>But the British Ambassador and the
Duchess of Varna were weighing the chances
of a Grant being allowed by Parliament
for the excavation of Chedorlahomor.</p>

<p>“Dear little Chedor,” the Duchess kept
on saying, “I’m sure one would find the
most enthralling things there. Aren’t <i>you</i>,
Sir Somebody?”</p>

<p>And they were still absorbed in their
colloquy when the King gave the signal to
rise.</p>

<p>Although King William had bidden
several distinguished Divas from the Opera
House to give an account of themselves for
the entertainment of his guests, both King
Jotifa and Queen Thleeanouhee with disarming
candour declared that, to their ears,
the music of the West was hardly to be
borne.</p>

<p>“Well I’m not very fond of it either,”
her Dreaminess admitted, surrendering her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
skirts to a couple of rosy boys, and leading
the way with airy grace towards an adjacent
salon, “although,” she wistfully added
across her shoulder, to a high dignitary of
the Church, “I’m trying, it’s true, to coax
the dear Archbishop to give the first act of
<i>La Tosca</i> in the Blue Jesus.... Such a
perfect setting, and with Desir&eacute; Erlinger
and Maggie Mellon...!”</p>

<p>And as the Court now pressed after her
the rules of etiquette became considerably
relaxed. Mingling freely with his guests,
King William had a hand-squeeze and a
fleeting word for each.</p>

<p>“In England,” he paused to enquire
of Lady Something, who was warning a
dowager, with impressive earnestness,
against the Ritz, “have you ever seen two
cooks in a kitchen-garden?”</p>

<p>“No, never, sir!” Lady Something
simpered.</p>

<p>“Neither,” the King replied moving on,
“have <i>we</i>.”</p>

<p>The Ambassadress beamed.</p>

<p>“My dear,” she told Sir Somebody, a
moment afterwards, “my dear, the King
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
was simply charming. Really I may say
he was more than gracious! He asked me
if I had ever seen two cooks in a kitchen-garden,
and I said no, never! And he
said that neither, either, had he! And
oh isn’t it so strange how few of us ever
have?”</p>

<p>But in the salon, one of Queen Thleeanouhee’s
ladies had been desired by her
Dreaminess to sing.</p>

<p>“It seems so long,” she declared, “since
I heard an Eastern voice, and it would be
such a relief.”</p>

<p>“By all means,” Queen Thleeanouhee
said, “and let a <i>darbouka</i> or two be brought!
For what charms the heart more, what
touches it more,” she asked, considering
meditatively her babouched feet, “than a
<i>darbouka</i>?”</p>

<p>It was told that, in the past, her life had
been a gallant one, although her adventures,
it was believed, had been mostly
with men. Those however, who had
observed her conduct closely, had not
failed to remark how often her eyes had
been attracted in the course of the evening
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
towards the dimpled cheeks of the British
Ambassadress.</p>

<p>Perceiving her ample form not far away,
Queen Thleeanouhee signalled to her
amiably to approach.</p>

<p><i>N&eacute;e</i> Rosa Bark (and a daughter of the
Poet) Lady Something was perhaps not
sufficiently tactful to meet all the difficulties
of the r&ocirc;le in which it had pleased
life to call her. But still, she tried, and
did do her best, which often went far to
retrieve her lack of <i>savoir faire</i>. “Life is
like that, dear,” she would sometimes say
to Sir Somebody, but she would never say
what it was that life was like. ‘<i>That</i>,’ it
seemed....</p>

<p>“I was just looking for my daughter,”
she declared.</p>

<p>“And is she as sympathetic,” Queen
Thleeanouhee softly asked, “as her
mamma?”</p>

<p>“She’s shy&mdash;of the Violet persuasion,
but that’s not a bad thing in a young girl.”</p>

<p>“Where <i>I</i> reign, shyness is a quality
which is entirely unknown...!”</p>

<p>“It must be astonishing, ma’am,” Lady
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
Something replied, caressing a parure of
false jewels, intended, indeed, to deceive
no one, “to be a Queen of a sun-steeped
country like yours.”</p>

<p>Queen Thleeanouhee fetched a sigh.</p>

<p>“Dateland&mdash;my dear, it’s a scorch!”
she averred.</p>

<p>“I conclude, ma’am, it’s what <i>we</i> should
call ‘conservatory’ scenery?” Lady Something
murmured.</p>

<p>“It is the land of the jessamine-flower,
the little amorous jessamine-flower,” the
Queen gently cooed with a sidelong smiling
glance, “that twines itself sometimes to
the right-hand, at others to the left, just
according to its caprices!”</p>

<p>“It sounds I fear to be unhealthy,
ma’am.”</p>

<p>“And it is the land also, of romance, my
dear, where <i>shyness</i> is a quality which is
entirely unknown,” the Queen broke off,
as one of her ladies, bearing a <i>darbouka</i>,
advanced with an air of purposefulness
towards her.</p>

<p>The hum of voices which filled the room
might well have tended to dismay a vocalist
of modest powers, but the young matron
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
known to the Court as ‘Tropical Molly,’
and whom her mistress addressed as Timzra,
soon shewed herself to be equal to the
occasion.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Under the blue gum-tree<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I am sitting waiting,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Under the blue gum-tree<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I am waiting all alone!”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Her voice reached the ears of the fresh-faced
ensigns and the beardless subalterns
in the Guard Room far beyond, and startled
the pages in the distant dormitories, as
they lay smoking on their beds.</p>

<p>And then, the theme changing, and with
an ever-increasing passion, fervour and
force:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“I heard a Watch-dog in the night ...<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Wailing, wailing ...<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Why is the watch-dog wailing?<br /></span>
<span class="i1">He is wailing for the Moon!”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>“That is one of the very saddest songs,”
the King remarked, “that I have ever
heard. ‘Why is the watchdog wailing?
He is wailing for the Moon!’” And the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
ambitions and mortifications of kingship,
for a moment weighed visibly upon him.</p>

<p>“Something merrier, Timzra!” Queen
Thleeanouhee said.</p>

<p>And throwing back her long love-lilac
sleeves, Timzra sang:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“A negress with a margaret once, lolled frousting in the sun<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Thinking of all the little things that she had left undone ...<br /></span>
<span class="i1">With a hey, hey, hey, hey, hi, hey ho!”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>“She has the air of a cannibal!” the
Archduchess murmured behind her fan to
his Weariness, who had scarcely opened his
lips except to yawn throughout the whole
of the evening.</p>

<p>“She has the air of a &mdash;&mdash;” he replied,
laconically, turning away.</p>

<p>Since the conversation with his mother
earlier in the day, his thoughts had revolved
incessantly around Laura. What had they
been saying to the poor wee witch, and
whereabouts was she to be found?</p>

<p>Leaving the salon, in the wake of a pair
of venerable politicians, who were helping
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
each other along with little touches and
pats, he made his way towards the ballroom,
where a new dance known as the
Pisgah Pas was causing some excitement,
and gaining a post of vantage, it was not
long before he caught a glimpse of the agile,
boyish figure of his betrothed. She passed
him, without apparently noticing he was
there, in a whirlwind of black tulle, her
little hand pressed to the breast of a man
like a sulky eagle; and he could not help
rejoicing inwardly, that, <i>once</i> his wife, it
would no longer be possible for her to enjoy
herself exactly with whom she pleased.
As she swept by again he succeeded in
capturing her attention, and nodding meaningly
towards a deserted picture-gallery,
wandered away towards it. It was but
seldom he set foot there, and he amused
himself by examining some of the pictures
to be seen upon the walls. An old shrew
with a rose ... a drawing of a man alone
in the last extremes ... a pink-robed
Christ ... a seascape, painted probably
in winter, with cold, hard colouring....</p>

<p>“Yousef?”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span></p>

<p>“Rara!”</p>

<p>“Let us go outside, dear.”</p>

<p>A night so absolutely soft and calm, was
delicious after the glare and noise within.</p>

<p>“With whom,” he asked, “sweetheart,
were you last dancing?”</p>

<p>“Only the brother of one of the Queen’s
Maids, dear,” Mademoiselle de Nazianzi
replied. “After dinner, though,” she
tittered, “when he gets Arabian-Nighty,
it’s apt to annoy one a scrap!”</p>

<p>“<i>Arabian-Nighty?</i>”</p>

<p>“Oh, never mind!”</p>

<p>“But (pardon me dear) I do.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be tiresome, Yousef! The night
is too fine,” she murmured glancing absently
away towards the hardly moving trees,
from whose branches a thousand drooping
necklets of silver lamps palely burned.</p>

<p>Were <i>those</i> the “bladders” then?</p>

<p>Strolling on down hoops of white wisteria
in the moon they came to the pillared circle
of a rustic-temple, commanding a prospect
on the town.</p>

<p>“There,” she murmured smiling elfishly,
and designating something, far below them,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
through the moonmist, with her fan: “is
the column of Justice and,” she laughed a
little, “of <i>Liberty</i>!”</p>

<p>“And there,” he pointed inconsequently,
“is <i>the Automobile Club</i>!”</p>

<p>“And beyond it ... The Convent of
the Flaming-Hood....”</p>

<p>“And those blue revolving lights; can
you see them, Rara?”</p>

<p>“Yes, dear ... what are <i>they</i>, Yousef?”</p>

<p>“Those,” he told her, contemplating her
beautiful white face against the dusky
bloom, “are the lights of the Caf&eacute;
Cleopatra!”</p>

<p>“And what,” she questioned, as they
sauntered on, pursued by all the sweet
perfumes of the night, “are those berried-shrubs,
that smell so passionately?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” he said: “Kiss me,
Rara!”</p>

<p>“No, no.”</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“Not now!”</p>

<p>“Put your arm about me, dear.”</p>

<p>“What a boy he is!” she murmured,
gazing up into the starry clearness.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span></p>

<p>Overhead a full moon, a moon of circumstance,
rode high in the sky, defining
phantasmally far off, the violet-farded hills
beyond the town.</p>

<p>“To be out there among the silver bean-fields!”
he said.</p>

<p>“Yes, Yousef,” she sighed, starting at a
Triton’s face among the trailing ivy on the
castle wall. Beneath it, half concealed
by water-flags, lay a miniature lake: as a
rule now, nobody went near the lake at all,
since the Queen had called it ‘<i>appallingly
smelly</i>,’ so that, for rendezvous, it was quite
ideal.</p>

<p>“Tell me, Yousef,” she presently said,
pausing to admire the beautiful shadow of
an orange-tree on the path before them:
“tell me, dear, when Life goes like that to
one&mdash;what does one do!!”</p>

<p>He shrugged. “Usually nothing,” he
replied, the tip of his tongue (like the point
of a blade) peeping out between his teeth.</p>

<p>“Ah, but isn’t that being strong?” she
said half-audibly, fixing her eyes as though
fascinated upon his lips.</p>

<p>“Why,” he demanded with an engaging
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
smile that brought half-moons to his hollow
cheeks: “What has the world been doing
to Rara?”</p>

<p>“At this instant, Yousef,” she declared,
“it brings her nothing but Joy!”</p>

<p>“You’re happy, my sweet, with me?”</p>

<p>“No one knows, dearest, how much I
love you.”</p>

<p>“Kiss me, Rara,” he said again.</p>

<p>“Bend, then,” she answered, as the
four quarters of the twelve strokes of
midnight rang out leisurely from the castle
clock.</p>

<p>“I’ve to go to the Ritz!” he announced.</p>

<p>“And <i>I</i> should be going in.”</p>

<p>Retracing reluctantly their steps they
were soon in earshot of the ball, and their
close farewells were made accompanied by
selections from <i>The Blue Banana</i>.</p>

<p>She remained a few moments gazing as
though entranced at his retreating figure,
and would have, perhaps, run after him
with some little capricious message, when
she became aware of someone watching her
from beneath the shadow of a garden vase.</p>

<p>Advancing steadily and with an air of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
nonchalance, she recognised the delicate,
sexless silhouette and slightly hunched
shoulders of Olga Blumenghast, whose
exotic attraction had aroused not a few
heartburnings (and even feuds) among
several of the grandes dames about the
court.</p>

<p>Poised flatly against the vases’ sculptured
plinth, she would have scarcely
have been discernible, but for the silver
glitter of her gown.</p>

<p>“Olga? Are you faint?”</p>

<p>“No; only my slippers are <i>torture</i>.”</p>

<p>“I’d advise you to change them, then!”</p>

<p>“It’s not altogether my feet, dear, that
ache....”</p>

<p>“Ah, I see,” Mademoiselle de Nazianzi
said, stooping enough to scan the stormy,
soul-tossed eyes of her friend:   “you’re
suffering, I suppose on account of Ann-Jules?”</p>

<p>“He’s such a gold-fish, Rara ... any
fingers that will throw him bread....”</p>

<p>“And there’s no doubt, I’m afraid,
that lots do!” Mademoiselle de Nazianzi
answered lucidly, sinking down by her side.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span></p>

<p>“I would give all my soul to him, Rara
... my chances of heaven!”</p>

<p>“Your chances, Olga&mdash;&mdash;” Mademoiselle
de Nazianzi murmured, avoiding some bird-droppings
with her skirt.</p>

<p>“How I envy <i>the men</i>, Rara, in his
platoon!”</p>

<p>“Take away his uniform, Olga, and what
does he become?”</p>

<p>“Ah <i>what</i>&mdash;&mdash;!”</p>

<p>“No.... Believe me, my dear, he’s not
worth the trouble!”</p>

<p>Mademoiselle Blumenghast clasped her
hands brilliantly across the nape of her
neck.</p>

<p>“I want to possess him at dawn, at
dawn,” she broke out: “Beneath a sky
striped with green....”</p>

<p>“Oh, Olga!”</p>

<p>“And I never shall rest,” she declared,
turning away on a languid heel, “until I
<i>do</i>.”</p>

<p>Meditating upon the fever of Love,
Mademoiselle de Nazianzi directed her course
slowly towards her room. She lodged in
that part of the palace known as ‘The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
Bachelors’ Wing,’ where she had a delicious
little suite just below the roof.</p>

<p>“If she loved him absolutely,” she told
herself, as she turned the handle of her
door, “she would not care about the
colour of the sky&mdash;; even if it snowed, or
hailed!”</p>

<p>Depositing her fan upon the lid of an old
wedding-chest that formed a couch, she
smiled contentedly about her. It would
be a wrench abandoning this little apartment
that she had identified already with
herself, when the day should come to leave
it for others more spacious in the Keep.
Although scarcely the size of a ship’s cabin,
it was amazing how many people one could
receive together at a time merely by pushing
the piano back against the wall, and wheeling
the wedding-chest on to the stairs, and
once no fewer than seventeen persons had
sat down to a birthday <i>f&ecirc;te</i>, without being
made too much to feel like herrings. In the
so-called salon, divided from her bedroom
by a folding lacquer screen, hung a few
studies in oils executed by herself, and
which, except to the initiated, or the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
naturally instinctive, looked sufficiently
enigmatic against a wall-paper with a
stealthy design.</p>

<p>Yes it would be a wrench to quit the
little place, she reflected, as she began
setting about her toilet for the night. It
was agreeable going to bed late without
anybody’s aid, when one could pirouette
interestingly before the mirror in the last
stages of d&eacute;shabille, and do a thousand
(and one) things besides<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> that one might
otherwise lack the courage for. But this
evening being in no frivolous mood, she
changed her ball-dress swiftly for a robe-de-chambre
bordered deeply with ermins,
that made her feel nearer somehow to
Yousef, and helped her to realise, in its
various facets, her position as future Queen.</p>

<p>“Queen!” she breathed, trailing her fur
flounces towards the window.</p>

<p>Already the blue revolving lights of the
Caf&eacute; Cleopatra were growing paler with the
dawn, and the moon had veered a little
towards the Convent of the Flaming-Hood.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
Ah ... how often as a lay boarder there
had she gazed up towards the palace
wondering half-shrinkingly what life “in
the world” was like; for there had been
a period indeed, when the impulse to take
the veil had been strong with her&mdash;more,
perhaps, to be near one of the nuns whom
she had <i>idolised</i> than from any more
immediate vocation.</p>

<p>She remained immersed in thoughts, her
introspectiveness fanned insensibly by the
floating zephyrs that spring with morning.
The slight sway-sway of the trees, the
awakening birds in the castle eaves, the
green-veined bougainvilleas that fringed
her sill&mdash;these thrilled her heart with joy.
All virginal in the early dawn what magic
the world possessed! Slow speeding clouds
like knots of pink roses came blowing across
the sky, sailing away in titanic bouquets
above the town.</p>

<p>Just such a morning should be their
wedding-day! she mused, beginning lightly
to apply the contents of a jar of Milk of
Almonds to her breast and arms. Ah,
before that Spina Christi lost its leaves,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
or that swallow should migrate ... that
historic day would come!</p>

<p>Troops ... hysteria ... throngs....
The Blue Jesus packed to suffocation....
She could envisage it all.</p>

<p>And there would be a whole holiday in
the Convent, she reflected falling drowsily
at her bedside to her knees.</p>

<p>“Oh! help me heaven,” she prayed, “to
be decorative and to do right! Let me
always look young, never more than sixteen
or seventeen&mdash;at the <i>very</i> outside, and let
Yousef love me&mdash;as much as I do him.
And I thank you for creating such a darling,
God (for he’s a perfect dear), and I can’t
tell you how much I love him; especially
when he wags it! I mean his tongue....
Bless all the sisters at the Flaming-Hood&mdash;above
all Sister Ursula ... and be sweet,
besides, to old Jane.... Shew me the
straight path! And keep me ever free
from the malicious scandal of the Court:
Amen.”</p>

<p>And her orisons (ending in a brief self-examination)
over, Mademoiselle de Nazianzi
climbed into bed.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span></p>

<h2 id="III">III</h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">In</span> the Salle de Prince or Cabinet
d’Antoine, above the Caf&eacute; Cleopatra,
Madame Wetme the wife of the proprietor,
sat perusing the Court gazettes.</p>

<p>It was not often that a <i>cabinet particulier</i>
like Antoine was disengaged at luncheon
time, being as a rule reserved many days
in advance, but it had been a ‘funny’
season, as the saying went, and there was
the possibility that a party of late-risers
might look in yet (officers, or artistes
from the Halls), who had been passing a
night on the ‘tiles.’ But Madame Wetme
trusted not. It was pleasant to escape
every now and again from her lugubrious
back-drawing-room that only faced a
wall, or to peruse the early newspapers
without having first to wait for them.
And to-day precisely was the day for the
hebdomadal <i>causerie</i> in the <i>Jaw-waws’
Journal</i> on matters appertaining to society,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
signed by that ever popular diarist “Eva
Schnerb.”</p>

<p>“Never,” Madame Wetme read, ”was a
gathering more brilliant than that which I
witnessed last night! I stood in a corner
of the Great ball room and literally <i>gasped</i>
at the wealth of jewels.... Beauty and
bravery abounded but no one, <i>I</i> thought,
looked better than our most-gracious Queen,
etc.... Among the supper-guests I saw
their Excellencies Prince and Princess Paul
de Pismiche,&mdash;the Princess impressed me as
being <i>just</i> a trifle pale: she is by no means
strong, and unhappily our nefarious climate
does not agree with everybody! Their
Excellencies, Sir Somebody and Lady Something
(Miss Ivy Something charming in
cornflower <i>charmeuse</i> danced indefatigably
all the evening, as did also one of the de
Lamb&egrave;se girls). The Count and Countess
of Tolga&mdash;she all in blue furs and literally
<i>ablaze</i> with gorgeous gems (I hear on excellent
authority she is shortly relinquishing
her post of Woman of the Bedchamber
which she finds is really too arduous for
her). The Duchess of Varna, looking veritably
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
radiant (by the way where has she
been?) in the palest of pistachio-green mashlaks,
which are all the rage at present.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“<i>Have you a Mashlak?</i></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“Owing to the visit of King Jotifa and
Queen Thleeanouhee, the Eastern mashlak
is being worn by many of the smart women
about the Court. I saw an example at
the Opera the other night in silver and gold
<i>lam&eacute;</i> that I thought too&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Madame Wetme broke off to look up,
as a waiter entered the room.</p>

<p>“Did Madame ring?”</p>

<p>“No!...”</p>

<p>“Then it must have been ‘Ptolomy’!”
the young man murmured, bustling out.</p>

<p>“I daresay. When will you know your
bells?” Madame Wetme retorted, returning
with a headshake to the gazette: Her
beloved Eva was full of information this
week and breathlessly she read on:</p>

<p>“I saw Minnie, Lady Violetrock (whose
daughter Sonia is being educated here)
at the garden <i>f&ecirc;te</i> the other day, at the
Ch&acirc;teau des Fleurs, looking chic as she
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
<i>always</i> does, in a combination of petunia
and purple ninon raffling a donkey.</p>

<p>“I hear on the best authority that before
the Court goes to the Summer-Palace later
on, there will be at least <i>one</i> more Drawing-room.
Applications, from those entitled
to attend, should be made to the Lord
Chamberlain as <i>soon</i> as possible.”</p>

<p>One more Drawing-room&mdash;! the journal
fell from Madame Wetme’s hand.</p>

<p>“I’m getting on now,” she reflected,
“and if I’m not presented soon, I never
will be....”</p>

<p>She raised imploring eyes to the mural
imagery&mdash;to the “Cleopatra couchant,” to
the “Arrival of Anthony,” to the “Sphinx,”
to the “Temple of Ra,” as though seeking
inspiration: “Ah my God!” she groaned.</p>

<p>But Madame Wetme’s religion, her cruel
God, was the <i>Chic</i>: The God Chic.</p>

<p>The sound of music from below reached
her faintly. There was not a better
orchestra (even at the Palace) than that
which discoursed at the Caf&eacute; Cleopatra&mdash;and
they played, the thought had sometimes
pleased her, the same identical tunes!
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span></p>

<p>“Does it say when?” she murmured,
reopening the gazette. No: But it would
be “before” the Court left.... And when
would that be?</p>

<p>“I have good grounds for believing,”
she continued to read: “that in order to
meet his creditors, the Duke of Varna is
selling a large portion of his country estate.”</p>

<p>If it were true ... Madame Wetme’s
eyes rested in speculation on the Oleanders
in the great flower-tubs before the Caf&eacute;,
if it were true, why the Varnas must be
desperate, and the Duchess ready to do
anything. “Anything&mdash;for remuneration,”
she murmured, rising and going towards a
table usually used for correspondence. And
seating herself with a look of decision, she
opened a leather writing-pad, full of crab-coloured
ink-marked blotting paper.</p>

<p>In the fan-shaped mirror above the
writing-table she could see herself in fancy,
all veils and aigrettes, as she would be on
“the day” when coiffed by Ernst.</p>

<p>“Among a bevy of charming d&eacute;butantes,
no one looked more striking than Madame
Wetme, who was presented by the Duchess
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
of Varna.” Being a client of the house
(with an unpaid bill) she could <i>dictate</i> to
Eva.... But first, of course, she must
secure the Duchess. And taking up her
pen she wrote: “Madame Wetme would
give the Duchess of Varna fifty thousand
crowns to introduce her at Court.” A trifle
terse perhaps?? Madame Wetme considered.
How if the Duchess should take
offence.... It was just conceivable! And
besides, by specifying no fixed sum, she
might be got for less.</p>

<p>“Something more mysterious, more
delicate in style....” Madame Wetme
murmured with a sigh, beginning the letter
anew:</p>

<p>“If the Duchess of Varna will call on
Madame Wetme this afternoon, about five,
and partake of a cup of tea, she will hear
of something <i>to her advantage</i>.”</p>

<p>Madame Wetme smiled: “That should
get her!” she reflected, and selecting an
envelope, she directed it boldly to the Ritz.
“Being hard up, she is sure to be there!”
she reasoned, as she left the room in quest
of a page.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span></p>

<p>The French maid of the Duchess of Varna
was just putting on her mistress’s shoes, in
a private sitting-room at the Ritz, when
Madame Wetme’s letter arrived.</p>

<p>The pleasure of being in the capital once
more, after a long spell of the country, had
given her an appetite for her lunch and she
was feeling braced after an excellent meal.</p>

<p>“I shall not be back, I expect, till late,
Louison,” she said to her maid, “and
should anyone enquire where I am, I shall
either be at the Palace, or at the Skating-Rink.”</p>

<p>“Madame la Duchesse will not be going
to her corsetier’s?”</p>

<p>“It depends if there’s time. What did
I do with my shopping-list?” the Duchess
replied, gathering up abstractedly a large,
becoroneted vanity-case and a parasol. She
had a gown of khaki and daffodil and a
black tricorne hat trimmed with green.
“Give me my other sunshade, the jade&mdash;and
don’t forget&mdash;: On me trouvera, Soit
au Palais Royal, soit, au Palais de Glace!”
she enjoined sailing quickly out.</p>

<p>Leaving the Ritz by a side door, she
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
found herself in a quiet, shady street,
bordering the Regina Gardens. Above a
sky so blue, so clear, so luminous seemed to
cry out: “Nothing matters! Why worry?
Be sanguine! Amuse yourself! Nothing
matters!”</p>

<p>Traversing the gardens, her mind preoccupied
by Madame Wetme’s note, the
Duchess branched off into a busy thoroughfare,
leading towards the Opera, in whose
vicinity lay the city’s principal shops. To
learn of anything to one’s advantage was,
of course, always welcome, but there were
various other claims upon her besides that
afternoon, which she was unable, or loath
to ignore&mdash;the palace, a <i>th&eacute; dansant</i> or two,
and then her favourite rink ... although
the unfortunate part was, most of the rink
instructors were still unpaid, and, on the last
occasion she had hired a man to waltz with
her, he had taken advantage of the fact by
pressing her waist with greater freedom than
she felt he need have done.</p>

<p>Turning into the Opera Square with its
fine arcades, she paused, half furtively,
before a Florist’s shop. Only her solicitors
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
and a few in the secret were aware that the
premises known as <i>Haboubet of Egypt</i> were
her own; for fearful lest they might be
occupied one day by sheriffs’ officers, the
little business venture had been kept the
closest mystery. Lilies “from Karnak,”
Roses “from the Land of Punt” (all grown
in the gardens of her country house, in the
purlieus of the capital) found immediate and
daily favour among amateurs of the choice.
Indeed as her gardener frequently said, the
demand for Roses from the Land of Punt,
was more than he could possibly cope with
without an extra man.</p>

<p>“I may as well run in and take whatever
there’s in the till,” she reflected&mdash;“not
that, I fear, there’s much....”</p>

<p>The superintendent, a slim Tunisian boy,
was crouching pitcher-posture upon the floor,
chanting languidly to himself, his head
supported by an osier pannier lately arrived
from “Punt.”</p>

<p>“Up, Bachir!” the Duchess upbraided.
“Remember the fresh consignments perish,
while you dream there and sing.”</p>

<p>The young Tunisian smiled.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span></p>

<p>He worshipped the Duchess, and the song
he was improvising as she entered, had been
inspired by her. In it (had she known) he
had led her by devious tender stages to his
Father’s fondouk at Tifilalet “on the blue
Lake of Fetzara,” where he was about to
present her to the Cheikh, and the whole
assembled village, as his chosen bride.</p>

<p>The Duchess considered him. He had a
beautiful face spoiled by a bad complexion,
which doubtless (the period of puberty
passed) he would outgrow.</p>

<p>“Consignment him come not two
minute,” the youth replied.</p>

<p>“Ah Bachir? Bachir!”</p>

<p>“By the glorious Koran, I will swear it.”</p>

<p>“Be careful not to shake those <i>Alexandrian
Balls</i>,” the Duchess peremptorily
enjoined pointing towards some Guelder-roses&mdash;“or
they’ll fall before they’re sold!”</p>

<p>“No matter at all. They sold already!
An American lady this morning, she purchase
all my Alexandrian-Balls; two heavy
bunch.”</p>

<p>“Let me see your takings.”...</p>

<p>With a smile of triumph, Bachir turned
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
towards the till. He had the welfare of
the establishment at heart as well as his
own, and of an evening often he would flit,
garbed in his long gandourah, through the
chief Caf&eacute;s and Dancings’ of the city, a
vast pannier heaped high with flowers upon
his head, which he would dispose of to
dazzled clients for an often exorbitant sum.
But for these excursions of his (which ended
on occasion in adventure) he had received
no authority at all.</p>

<p>“Not so bad,” the Duchess commented:
“And, as there’s to be a Court again soon,
many orders for bouquets are sure to come
in!”</p>

<p>“I call in outside hands to assist me:
I summon Ouardi! He an Armenian boy.
Sympathetic. My friend. More attached
to him am I than a branch of Jessamine is
about a Vine.”</p>

<p>“I suppose he’s capable?” the Duchess
murmured, pinning a green-ribbed orchid
to her dress.</p>

<p>“The garlands of Ouardi would make
even a jackal look bewitching!”</p>

<p>“Ah: he has taste?”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span></p>

<p>“I engage my friend. Much work always
in the month of Redjeb!”</p>

<p>“Engage nobody,” the Duchess answered
as she left the shop, “until I come
again.”</p>

<p>Hailing one of the little shuttered cabs
of the city in the square she directed the
driver to drop her at the palace gates, and
pursued by an obstreperous newsboy with an
evening paper, yelling: “Chedorlahomor!
Sodom! Extra Special!” the cab clattered
off at a languid trot. Under the plane-trees,
near the Houses of Parliament, she
was overtaken by the large easy-stepping
horses of the Ambassadress of England, and
acknowledged with a winning movement
of the wrist, Lady Something’s passing
acceuil. It was yet not quite the correct
hour for the Promenade, where beneath
the great acacias Society liked best to ride
or drive, but, notwithstanding, that zealous
reporter of social deeds, the irrepressible
Eva Schnerb, was already on the prowl
and able with satisfaction to note: “I
saw the Duchess of Varna early driving
in the Park, all alone in a little one-horse
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
shay, that really looked more elegant than
any Delaunay-Belleville!”</p>

<p>Arriving before the palace gates, the
Duchess perceived an array of empty
carriages waiting in the drive, which made
her apprehensive of a function. She had
anticipated an intimate chat with the Queen
alone, but this it seemed was not to be.</p>

<p>Following a youthful page with a <i>resigned</i>
face, down a long black rug woven with
green and violet flowers, who left her with
a sigh (as if disappointed of a tip) in charge
of a couple of giggling colleagues, and who,
in turn, propelled her towards a band of
sophisticated-looking footmen and grim
officials, she was shewn at last into a vast
white drawing-room whose ceiling formed a
dome.</p>

<p>Knowing the Queen’s interest in the
Chedorlahomor Excavation Bill, a number
of representative folk, such as the wives of
certain Politicians or Diplomats, as well
as a few of her own more immediate circle,
had called to felicitate her upon its success.
Parliament had declared itself willing to
do the unlimited graceful by all those
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
concerned, and this in a great measure
was due to the brilliant wire pulling of
the Queen.</p>

<p>She was looking singularly French in a
gold helmet and a violet Vortniansky gown,
and wore a rope of faultless pearls, clasped
very high beneath the chin.</p>

<p>“I hope the Archbishop will bless the
Excavators’ tools!” she was saying to the
wife of the Premier, as the Duchess entered.
“The <i>picks</i> at any rate....”</p>

<p>That lady made no reply: In presence
of royalty she would usually sit and smile
at her knees, raising her eyes from time
to time to throw, beneath her lashes, an
ineffable expiring glance.</p>

<p>“God speed them safe home again!”
the Archduchess Elizabeth who was busy
knitting said. An ardent philanthropist she
had begun already making “comforts”
for the men, as the nights in the East are
cold. The most philanthropic perhaps of
all the Royal Family, her hobby was
designing, for the use of the public, sanitary,
but artistic, places of Necessity on a
novel system of ventilation. The King had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
consented to open (and it was expected
appropriately) one of these in course of
construction in the Opera Square.</p>

<p>“Amen,” the Queen answered, signalling
amiably to the Duchess of Varna, whose
infrequent visits to court disposed her
always to make a fuss of her.</p>

<p>But no fuss the Queen could make of the
Duchess of Varna, could exceed that being
made by Queen Thleeanouhee, in a far-off
corner, of her Excellency, Lady Something.
The sympathy, the <i>entente</i> indeed that had
arisen between these two ladies was exercising
considerably the minds of certain
members of the diplomatic corps, although
had anyone wished to eavesdrop, their
conversation upon the whole must have
been found to be anything but esoteric.</p>

<p>“What I want,” Queen Thleeanouhee
was saying, resting her hand confidentially
on her Excellency’s knee: “what I want is
an English maid with Frenchified fingers&mdash;&mdash;
Is there such a thing to be had?”</p>

<p>“But surely&mdash;&mdash;” Lady Something
smiled: for the servant-topic was one she
felt at home on.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span></p>

<p>“In Dateland, my dear, servant girls are
nothing but sluts.”</p>

<p>“Life is like <i>that</i>, ma’am, I regret indeed,
to have to say: I once had a housemaid
who had lived with Sarah Bernhardt, and
oh, wasn’t she a terror!” Lady Something
declared, warding off a little black bat-eared
dog who was endeavouring to scramble
on to her lap.</p>

<p>“Teddywegs, Teddywegs!” the Archduchess
exclaimed jumping up and advancing
to capture her pet: “He arrived from
London not later than this morning,” she
said: “from the Princess Elsie of England.”</p>

<p>“He looks like some special litter,” Lady
Something remarked.</p>

<p>“How the dear girl loves animals!”</p>

<p>“The rumour of her betrothal it seems
is quite without foundation?”</p>

<p>“To my nephew: ah alas....”</p>

<p>“Prince Yousef and she are of an equal
age!”</p>

<p>“She is interested in Yousef I’m inclined
to believe; but the worst of life is, nearly
everyone marches to a different tune,” the
Archduchess replied.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span></p>

<p>“One hears of her nothing that isn’t
agreeable.”</p>

<p>“Like her good mother, Queen Glory,”
the Archduchess said, “one feels, of course,
she’s all she should be.”</p>

<p>Lady Something sighed.</p>

<p>“Yes ... and even <i>more</i>!” she murmured,
letting fall a curtsy to King William
who had entered. He had been lunching
at the Headquarters of the Girl Guides, and
wore the uniform of a general.</p>

<p>“What is the acme of nastiness?” he
paused of the English Ambassadress to
enquire.</p>

<p>Lady Something turned paler than the
white candytuft that is found on ruins.
“Oh <i>la</i>, sir,” she stammered, “how should
I know!”</p>

<p>The King looked the shrinking matron
slowly up and down: “The supreme
disgust&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh <i>la</i>, sir!” Lady Something stammered
again.</p>

<p>But the King took pity on her evident
confusion: “Tepid potatoes,” he answered,
“on a stone-cold plate.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span></p>

<p>The Ambassadress beamed.</p>

<p>“I trust the warmth of the girls, sir,
compensated you for the coldness of the
plates?” she ventured.</p>

<p>“The inspection, in the main, was satisfactory!
Although I noticed that one or
two of the guides, seemed inclined to lead
astray,” the King replied, regarding Teddywegs,
who was inquisitively sniffing his
spurs.</p>

<p>“He’s strange yet to everything,” the
Archduchess commented.</p>

<p>“What’s this&mdash;a new dog?”</p>

<p>“From Princess Elsie....”</p>

<p>“They say she’s stupid, but I do not know
that intellect is always a blessing!” the
King declared, drooping his eyes to his
abdomen, with an air of pensive modesty.</p>

<p>“Poor child, she writes she is tied to the
shore, so that I suppose she is unable to
leave dear England.”</p>

<p>“Tied to it?”</p>

<p>“And bound till goodness knows.”</p>

<p>“As was Andromeda!” the King sententiously
exclaimed.... “She would have
little, or maybe nothing, to wear,” he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
clairvoyantly went on: “I see her standing
shivering, waiting for Yousef....
Chained by the leg, perhaps, exposed to the
howling winds.”<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></p>

<p>“Nonsense. She means to say she can’t
get away yet on account of her engagements:
that’s all.”</p>

<p>“After Cowes-week,” Lady Something
put in, “she is due to pay a round of visits
before joining her parents in the North.”</p>

<p>“How I envy her,” the Archduchess
sighed, “amid that entrancing scene....”</p>

<p>Lady Something looked <i>attendrie</i>.</p>

<p>“Your royal highness is attached to
England?” she asked.</p>

<p>“I fear I was never there.... But I
shall always remember I put my hair up
when I was twelve years old because of the
Prince of Wales.”</p>

<p>“Oh? And ... which of the Georges?”
Lady Something gasped.</p>

<p>“It’s so long ago now that I really forget.”</p>

<p>“And pray, ma’am, what was the point
of it?”</p>

<p>The Archduchess chuckled:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span></p>

<p>“Why, so as to look eligible of course!”
she replied, returning to her knitting.</p>

<p>Amid the general flutter following the
King’s appearance, it was easy enough for
the Duchess of Varna to slip away. Knowing
the palace inside out it was unnecessary
to make any fuss. Passing through a long
room, where a hundred holland-covered
chairs stood grouped, Congresswise, around
a vast table, she attained the Orangery,
that gave access to the drive. The mellay
of vehicles had considerably increased, and
the Duchess paused a moment to consider
which she should borrow, when recollecting
she wished to question one of the royal
gardeners on a little matter of mixing
manure, she decided to return through the
castle grounds instead. Taking a path
that descended between rhododendrons and
grim old cannons towards the town, she was
comparing the capriciousness of certain
bulbs to that of certain people, when she
heard her name called from behind, and
glancing round perceived the charming
silhouette of the Countess of Tolga.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t stand it inside: Could you?”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span></p>

<p>“My <i>dear</i>, what a honeymoon hat!”</p>

<p>“It was made by me!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Violet....” the Duchess murmured,
her face taking on a look of wonder.</p>

<p>“Don’t forget, dear, Sunday.”</p>

<p>“Is it a party?”</p>

<p>“I’ve asked Grim-lips and Ladybird,
Hairy and Fluffy, Hardylegs and Bluewings,
Spindleshanks, and Our Lady of Furs.”</p>

<p>“Not Nanny-goat?”</p>

<p>“Luckily ...” the Countess replied,
raising to her nose the heliotropes in her
hand.</p>

<p>“Is he no better?”</p>

<p>“You little know, dear, what it is to be all
alone with him chez soi when he thinks and
sneers into the woodwork.”</p>

<p>“<i>Into the woodwork?</i>”</p>

<p>“He addresses the ceiling, the walls, the
floor&mdash;me never!”</p>

<p>“Dear dove.”</p>

<p>“All I can I’m plastic.”</p>

<p>“Can one be plastic ever enough, dear?”</p>

<p>“Often but for Olga ...” the Countess
murmured, considering a little rosy ladybird
on her arm.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span></p>

<p>“I consider her ever so compelling, ever
so wistful&mdash;” the Duchess of Varna averred.</p>

<p>“Sweet girl&mdash;! She’s just my consolation.”</p>

<p>“She reminds me, does she you, of that
<i>Miss Hobart</i> in de Grammont’s <i>Memoirs</i>.”</p>

<p>“C’est une ame exquise!”</p>

<p>“Well au revoir, dear: We shall meet
again at the Princess Leucippe’s later on,”
the duchess said, detecting her gardener in
the offing.</p>

<p>By the time she had obtained her recipe
and cajoled a few special shoots from various
exotic plants, the sun had begun to decline.
Emerging from the palace by a postern-gate,
where lounged a sentry, she found herself
almost directly beneath the great acacias
on the Promenade. Under the lofty leafage
of the trees, as usual towards this hour,
society, in its varying grades had congregated
to be gazed upon. Mounted on
an eager-headed little horse his Weariness
(who loved being seen) was plying up and
down, while in his wake a “<i>screen artiste</i>,”
on an Arabian mare with powdered withers
and eyes made up with kohl, was creating
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
a sensation. Every time she used her whip
the powder rose in clouds. Wending her
way through the throng the duchess recognised
the rose-harnessed horses of
Countess Medusa Rappa&mdash;the Countess bolt
upright, her head carried stiffly staring with
a pathetic expression of dead <i>joie-de-vie</i>
between her coachman’s and footman’s
waists. But the intention of calling at the
Caf&eacute; Cleopatra caused the duchess to hasten.
The possibility of learning something beneficial
to herself was a lure not to be resisted.
Pausing to allow the marvellous blue automobile
of Count Ann-Jules to pass (with
the dancer Kalpurnia inside), she crossed
the Avenue, where there seemed, on the
whole, to be fewer people. Here she remarked
a little ahead of her the masculine
form of the Countess Yvorra, taking a quiet
stroll before <i>Salut</i> in the company of her
Confessor. In the street she usually walked
with her hands clasped behind her back,
huddled up like a statesman: “<i>Des choses
abominables!... Des choses hors nature!</i>”
she was saying, in tones of evident relish,
as the duchess passed.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span></p>

<p>Meanwhile Madame Wetme was seated
anxiously by the samovar in her drawing-room.
To receive the duchess, she had
assumed a mashlak &agrave; la mode, whitened her
face and rouged her ears, and set a small,
but costly aigrette at an insinuating angle
in the edifice of her hair. As the hour of
Angelus approached, the tension of waiting
grew more and more acute, and beneath
the strain of expectation even the little
iced-sugar cakes upon the tea-table looked
green with worry.</p>

<p>Suppose, after all, she shouldn’t come?
Suppose she had already left? Suppose
she were in prison? Only the other day
a woman of the highest fashion, a leader
of “society” with an <i>A</i>, had served
six months as a consequence of her
extravagance....</p>

<p>In agitation Madame Wetme helped herself
to a small glassful of <i>Cointreau</i>, (her
favourite liqueur) when, feeling calmer for
the consommation, she was moved to take
a peep out of Antoine.</p>

<p>But nobody chic at all met her eye.</p>

<p>Between the oleanders upon the curb,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
that rose up darkly against a flame-pink
sky, two young men dressed “as Poets”
were arguing and gesticulating freely over a
bottle of beer. Near them, a sailor with a
blue drooping collar and dusty boots (had
he walked, poor wretch, to see his mother?)
was gazing stupidly at the large evening
gnats that revolved like things bewitched
about the caf&eacute; lamps. While below the
window a lean soul in glasses, evidently an
impresario, was loudly exclaiming: “London
has robbed me of my throat, sir!! It has
deprived me of my voice.”</p>

<p>No, an “off” night certainly!</p>

<p>Through a slow, sun-flower of a door
(that kept on revolving long after it had
been pushed) a few military men bent on a
game of billiards, or an early <i>fille de joie</i> (only
the discreetest <i>des filles “serieuses”</i> were
supposed to be admitted)&mdash;came and went.</p>

<p>“To-night they’re fit for church,”
Madame Wetme complacently smiled as the
door swung round again: “Navy-blue and
silver-fox looks the goods,” she reflected,
“upon any occasion! It suggests something
sly&mdash;like a Nurse’s uniform.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span></p>

<p>“A lady in the drawing-room, Madame,
desires to speak to you,” a chasseur tunefully
announced, and fingering nervously
her aigrette Madame Wetme followed.</p>

<p>The Duchess of Varna was inspecting a
portrait with her back to the door as her
hostess entered.</p>

<p>“I see you’re looking at my Murillo!”
Madame Wetme began.</p>

<p>“Oh.... Is it o-ri-gi-nal?” the
duchess drawled.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“I <i>thought</i> not.”</p>

<p>“To judge by the Bankruptcy-sales of
late (and it’s curious how many there’ve
been ...) it would seem from the indifferent
figure he makes, that he is no
longer accounted chic,” Madame Wetme
observed as she drew towards the duchess
a chair.</p>

<p>“I consider the chic to be such a very
false religion!...” the duchess said,
accepting the seat which was offered her.</p>

<p>“Well, I come of an old Huguenot family
myself!”</p>

<p>“&mdash;&mdash;...?”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span></p>

<p>“Ah my early home.... Now, I
hear, it’s nothing but a weed-crowned
ruin.”</p>

<p>The duchess considered the ivory cat
handle of her parasol: “You wrote to me?”
she asked.</p>

<p>“Yes: about the coming court.”</p>

<p>“About it?”</p>

<p>“Every woman has her dream, duchess!
And mine’s to be presented.”</p>

<p>“The odd ambition!” the duchess
crooned.</p>

<p>“I admit we live in the valley. Although
<i>I</i> have a great sense of the hills!” Madame
Wetme declared demurely.</p>

<p>“Indeed?”</p>

<p>“My husband you see ...”</p>

<p>“...............”</p>

<p>“Ah! well!”</p>

<p>“Of course.”</p>

<p>“If I’m not asked this time, I shall die
of grief.”</p>

<p>“Have you made the request before?”</p>

<p>“I have attempted!”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“When the Lord Chamberlain refused
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
me, I shed tears of blood,” Madame Wetme
wanly retailed.</p>

<p>“It would have been easier, no doubt,
in the late king’s time!”</p>

<p>Madame Wetme took a long sighing
breath.</p>

<p>“I only once saw him in my life,” she
said, “and then he was standing against
a tree, in an attitude offensive to modesty.”</p>

<p>“Tell me ... as a public man, what
has your husband done&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“His money helped to avert, I always
contend, the noisy misery of a War!”</p>

<p>“He’s open-handed?”</p>

<p>“Ah ... as you would find....”</p>

<p>The duchess considered: “I <i>might</i>,”
she said, “get you cards for a State
concert....”</p>

<p>“A State concert, duchess? That’s no
good to me!”</p>

<p>“A drawing-room you know is a very
dull affair.”</p>

<p>“I will liven it!”</p>

<p>“Or an invitation perhaps to begin with
to one of the Embassies&mdash;the English for
instance might lead....”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span></p>

<p>“Nowhere...! You can’t depend on
that: people have asked me to lunch, and
left me to pay for them...! There is so
much trickery in Society....” Madame
Wetme laughed.</p>

<p>The duchess smiled quizzically: “I forget
if you know the Tolgas,” she said.</p>

<p>“By ‘name’!”</p>

<p>“The Countess is more about the throne
at present than I.”</p>

<p>“Possibly&mdash;but oh <i>you</i> who do <i>everything</i>,
duchess?” Madame Wetme entreated.</p>

<p>“I suppose there are things still one
wouldn’t do however&mdash;&mdash;!” the duchess
took offence.</p>

<p>“The Tolgas are so hard.”</p>

<p>“You want a misfortune and they’re
sweet to you. Successful persons they’re
positively hateful to!”</p>

<p>“These women of the Bedchamber are
all alike, so glorified. You would never
credit they were Chambermaids at all!
I often smile to myself when I see one
of them at a <i>premi&egrave;re</i> at the Opera,
gorged with pickings, and think that,
most likely, but an hour before she was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
stumbling along a corridor with a pailful
of slops!”</p>

<p>“You’re fond of music, Madame?” the
duchess asked.</p>

<p>“It’s my joy: I could go again and
again to <i>The Blue Banana</i>!”</p>

<p>“I’ve not been.”</p>

<p>“Pom-pom, pompity-pom! We might
go one night, perhaps, together.”</p>

<p>“...”</p>

<p>“Doudja Degdeg is always a draw,
although naturally now she is getting on!”</p>

<p>“And I fear so must I”&mdash;the duchess
rose remarking.</p>

<p>“So soon?”</p>

<p>“I’m only so sorry I can’t stay longer&mdash;&mdash;!”</p>

<p>“Then it’s all decided,” Madame Wetme
murmured archly as she pressed the bell.</p>

<p>“Oh I’d not say that.”</p>

<p>“If I’m not asked, remember this time,
I shall die with grief.”</p>

<p>“To-night the duke and I are dining
with the Leucippes, and possibly ...” the
duchess broke off to listen to the orchestra
in the caf&eacute; below, which was playing the
waltz-air from <i>Der Rosenkavalier</i>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span></p>

<p>“They play well!” she commented.</p>

<p>“People often tell me so.”</p>

<p>“It must make one restless, dissatisfied,
that yearning, yearning music continually
at the door?”</p>

<p>Madame Wetme sighed.</p>

<p>“It makes you often long,” she said, “to
begin your life again!”</p>

<p>“Again?”</p>

<p>“Really it’s queer I came to yoke myself
with a man so little fine....”</p>

<p>“Still&mdash;&mdash;! If he’s open-handed,” the
duchess murmured as she left the room.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span></p>

<h2 id="IV">IV</h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">One</span> grey, unsettled morning (it was
the first of June) the English
Colony of Kairoulla<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> awoke in arms.
It usually did when the Embassy entertained.
But the omissions of the Ambassador,
were, as old Mr Ladboyson the
longest-established member of the colony
declared, “not to be fathomed,” and many
of those overlooked declared they should go
all the same. Why should Mrs Montgomery
(who, when all was said and done, was
nothing but a governess) be invited and not
Mrs Barleymoon who was “nothing” (in
the most distinguished sense of the word)
at all? Mrs Barleymoon’s position, as a
captain’s widow with means, unquestionably
came before Mrs Montgomery’s, who
drew a salary, and hadn’t often an h.</p>

<p>Miss Grizel Hopkins, too&mdash;the cousin of
an Earl, and Mrs Bedley the “Mother” of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
the English Colony, both had been ignored.
It was true Ann Bedley kept a circulating
library and a tea-room combined and gave
“Information” to tourists as well (a thing
she had done these forty years), but was
that a sufficient reason why she should be
totally taboo? <i>No</i>, in old Lord Clanlubber’s
time all had been made welcome, and there
had been none of these heartburnings at all.
Even the Irish coachman of the Archduchess
was known to have been received&mdash;although
it had been outside of course upon the lawn.
Only gross carelessness, it was felt, on the
part of those attach&eacute;s could account for the
extraordinary present neglect.</p>

<p>“I don’t myself mind much,” Mrs Bedley
said, who was seated over a glass of morning
milk and “a plate of fingers” in the <i>Circulating</i>
end of the shop: “going out at night
upsets me. And the last time Dr Babcock
was in he warned me not.”</p>

<p>“What is the Embassy there for but
to be hospitable?” Mrs Barleymoon demanded
from the summit of a ladder,
from where she was choosing herself a
book.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span></p>

<p>“You’re shewing your petticoat, dear&mdash;excuse
me telling you,” Mrs Bedley observed.</p>

<p>“When will you have something new,
Mrs Bedley?”</p>

<p>“Soon, dear ... soon.”</p>

<p>“It’s always ‘soon,’” Mrs Barleymoon
complained.</p>

<p>“Are you looking for anything, Bessie, in
particular?” a girl, with loose blue eyes
that did not seem quite firm in her head, and
a literary face enquired.</p>

<p>“No, only something,” Mrs Barleymoon
replied, “I’ve not had before and before
and before.”</p>

<p>“By the way, Miss Hopkins,” Mrs Bedley
said, “I’ve to fine you for pouring tea over
<i>My Stormy Past</i>.”</p>

<p>“It was coffee, Mrs Bedley&mdash;not tea.”</p>

<p>“Never mind, dear, what it was the charge
for a stain is the same as you know,” Mrs
Bedley remarked, turning to attend to Mrs
Montgomery who, with his Lankiness, Prince
Olaf, had entered the Library.</p>

<p>“Is it in?” Mrs Montgomery mysteriously
asked.</p>

<p>Mrs Bedley assumed her glasses.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span></p>

<p>“<i>Mmnops</i>,” she replied, peering with an
air of secretiveness in her private drawer
where she would sometimes reserve or
‘hold back’ a volume for a subscriber who
happened to be in her special good graces.</p>

<p>“I’ve often said,” Mrs Barleymoon from
her ladder sarcastically let fall, “that Mrs
Bedley has her pets!”</p>

<p>“You are all my pets, my dear,” Mrs
Bedley softly cooed.</p>

<p>“Have you read <i>Men&mdash;my Delight</i>,
Bessie?” Miss Hopkins asked, “by Cora
Velasquez.”</p>

<p>“No!”</p>

<p>“It’s not perhaps a very.... It’s about
two dark, and three fair, men,” she added
vaguely.</p>

<p>“Most women’s novels seem to run off
the rails before they reach the end, and I’m
not very fond of them,” Mrs Barleymoon
said.</p>

<p>“And anyway, dear, it’s out,” Mrs Bedley
asserted.</p>

<p>“<i>The Passing of Rose</i> I read the other
day,” Mrs Montgomery said, “and <i>so</i>
enjoyed it.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span></p>

<p>“Isn’t that one of Ronald Firbank’s
books?”</p>

<p>“No, dear, I don’t think it is. But I
never remember an author’s name and I
don’t think it matters!”</p>

<p>“I suppose I’m getting squeamish! But
this Ronald Firbank I can’t take to at all.
<i>Valmouth!</i> Was there ever a novel more
coarse. I assure you I hadn’t gone very
far when I had to put it down.”</p>

<p>“It’s <i>out</i>,” Mrs Bedley suavely said,
“as well,” she added, “as the rest of
them.”</p>

<p>“I once met him,” Miss Hopkins said,
dilating slightly the <i>retin&aelig;</i> of her eyes:
“He told me writing books was by no
means easy!”</p>

<p>Mrs Barleymoon shrugged.</p>

<p>“Have you nothing more enthralling,
Mrs Bedley,” she persuasively asked,
“tucked away?”</p>

<p>“Try <i>The Call of the Stage</i>, dear,” Mrs
Bedley suggested.</p>

<p>“You forget, Mrs Bedley,” Mrs Barleymoon
replied, regarding solemnly her <i>cr&ecirc;pe</i>.</p>

<p>“Or <i>Mary of the Manse</i>, dear.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span></p>

<p>“I’ve read <i>Mary of the Manse</i> twice,
Mrs Bedley&mdash;and I don’t propose to read it
again.”</p>

<p>“..........?”</p>

<p>“..........!”</p>

<p>Mrs Bedley became abstruse.</p>

<p>“It’s dreadful how many poets take to
drink,” she reflected.</p>

<p>A sentiment to which her subscribers
unanimously assented.</p>

<p>“I’m taking <i>Men are Animals</i>, by the
Hon. Mrs Victor Smythe, and <i>What Every
Soldier Ought to Know</i>, Mrs Bedley,” Miss
Hopkins breathed.</p>

<p>“And I <i>The East is Whispering</i>,” Mrs
Barleymoon in hopeless tones affirmed.</p>

<p>“Robert Hitchinson! He’s a good
author.”</p>

<p>“Do you think so? I feel his books are
all written in hotels with the bed unmade
at the back of the chair.”</p>

<p>“And I daresay you’re right, my dear.”</p>

<p>“Well, Mrs Bedley, I must go&mdash;if I want
to walk to my husband’s grave,” Mrs
Barleymoon declared.</p>

<p>“Poor Bessie Barleymoon,” Mrs Bedley
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
sighed, after Mrs Barleymoon and Miss
Hopkins had gone: “I fear she frets!”</p>

<p>“We all have our trials, Mrs Bedley.”</p>

<p>“And some more than others.”</p>

<p>“Court life, Mrs Bedley, it’s a funny
thing.”</p>

<p>“It looks as though we may have an
English Queen, Mrs Montgomery.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe it!”</p>

<p>“Most of the daily prints I see are devoting
leaders to the little dog the Princess
Elsie sent out the other day.”</p>

<p>“Odious, ill-mannered, horrid little
beast....”</p>

<p>“It seems, dear, he ran from room to room
looking for her until he came to the prince’s
door, where he just lay down and whined.”</p>

<p>“And what does that prove, Mrs Bedley?”</p>

<p>“I really don’t know, Mrs Montgomery.
But the press seemed to find it significant,’”
Mrs Bedley replied as a Nun of
the Flaming-Hood with a jolly face all gold
with freckles entered the shop:</p>

<p>“Have you <i>Valmouth</i> by Ronald Firbank
or <i>Inclinations</i> by the same author?” she
asked.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span></p>

<p>“Neither I’m sorry&mdash;both are out!”</p>

<p>“Maladetta ✠✠✠✠! But I’ll be
passing soon again,” the Sister answered
as she twinklingly withdrew.</p>

<p>“You’d not think now by the look of her
she had been at Girton!” Mrs Bedley
remarked.</p>

<p>“Once a Girton girl always a Girton girl,
Mrs Bedley.”</p>

<p>“It seems a curate drove her to it....”</p>

<p>“I’m scarcely astonished. Looking back
I remember the average curate at home
as something between a eunuch and a
snigger.”</p>

<p>“Still, dear, I could never renounce my
religion. As I said to the dear Chaplain
only the other day (while he was having
some tea), Oh, if only I were a man, I said!
Wouldn’t I like to <i>denounce</i> the disgraceful
goings on every Sabbath down the street at
the church of the Blue Jesus.”</p>

<p>“And I assure you it’s positively <i>nothing</i>,
Mrs Bedley, at the Jesus, to what it is at the
church of St Mary the Fair! I was at the
wedding of one of the equerries lately, and
never saw anything like it.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span></p>

<p>“It’s about time there was an English
wedding, in <i>my</i> opinion, Mrs Montgomery!”</p>

<p>“There’s not been one in the Colony
indeed for some time.”</p>

<p>Mrs Bedley smiled undaunted.</p>

<p>“I trust I may be spared to dance before
long at Dr and Mrs Babcock’s!” she
exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Kindly leave Cunnie out of it, Mrs
Bedley,” Mrs Montgomery begged.</p>

<p>“So it’s Cunnie already you call him!”</p>

<p>“Dr Cuncliffe and I scarcely meet.”</p>

<p>“People talk of the immense sameness
of marriage, Mrs Montgomery; but all the
same, my dear, a widow’s not much to be
envied.”</p>

<p>“There are times, it’s true, Mrs Bedley,
when a woman feels she needs fostering;
but it’s a feeling she should try to fight
against.”</p>

<p>“Ah my dear, I never could resist <i>a
mon</i>!” Mrs Bedley exclaimed.</p>

<p>Mrs Montgomery sighed.</p>

<p>“Once,” she murmured meditatively,
“men (those procurers of delights) engaged
me utterly.... I was their <i>slave</i>....
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
Now.... One does not burn one’s fingers
twice, Mrs Bedley.”</p>

<p>Mrs Bedley grew introspective.</p>

<p>“My poor husband sometimes would be
a little frightening, a little fierce ... at
night, my dear, especially. Yet how often
now I miss him!”</p>

<p>“You’re better off as you are, Mrs
Bedley, believe me,” Mrs Montgomery declared,
looking round for the little prince
who was amusing himself on the library-steps.</p>

<p>“You must find him a handful to
educate, my dear.”</p>

<p>“It will be a relief <i>indeed</i>, Mrs Bedley,
when he goes to Eton!”</p>

<p>“I’m told so long as a boy is grounded....”</p>

<p>“His English accent is excellent, Mrs
Bedley, and he shews quite a talent for
languages,” Mrs Montgomery assured.</p>

<p>“I’m delighted, I’m sure, to hear it!”</p>

<p>“Well, Mrs Bedley, I mustn’t stand
dawdling: I’ve to ’ave my ’air shampooed
and waved for the Embassy party to-night
you know!” And taking the little prince
by the hand, the Royal Governess withdrew.

<h2 id="V">V</h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">Among</span> those attached to the Chedorlahomor
expedition was a young&mdash;if
thirty-five be young&mdash;eccentric
Englishman from Wales, the Hon. ‘Eddy’
Monteith, a son of Lord Intriguer. Attached
first to one thing and then another, without
ever being attached to any, his life had been
a gentle series of attachments all along.
But this new attachment was surely something
better than a temporary secretaryship
to a minister, or “aiding” an ungrateful
general, or waiting in through draughts
(so affecting to the constitution) in the anterooms
of hard-worked royalty, in the purlieus
of Pall Mall. Secured by the courtesy
of his ex-chief, Sir Somebody Something,
an old varsity friend of his father, the billet
of “surveyor and occasional help” to the
Chedorlahomorian excavation party had
been waywardly accepted by the Hon.
‘Eddy’ just as he had been upon the point
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
of attaching himself, to the terror of his
relatives and the amusement of his friends,
to a monastery of the Jesuit Order, as a
likely candidate for the cowl.</p>

<p>Indeed he had already gone so far as to
sit to an artist for his portrait in the habit
of a monk, gazing ardently at what looked
to be the Escurial itself, but in reality
was nothing other than an “impression”
from the kitchen garden of Intriguer Park.
And now this sudden change, this call to
the East instead. There had been no time,
unfortunately, before setting out to sit
again in the picturesque “sombrero” of
an explorer, but a ready camera had performed
miracles, and the relatives of the
Hon. ‘Eddy’ were relieved to behold his
smiling countenance in the illustrated-weeklies,
pick in hand, or with one foot
resting on his spade while examining a
broken jar, with just below the various
editors’ comments: <i>To join the Expedition
to Chedorlahomor&mdash;the Hon. ‘Eddy’ Monteith,
only son of Lord Intriguer</i>; or, <i>Off to
Chedorlahomor!</i> or, <i>Bon Voyage</i>...!</p>

<p>Yes, the temptation of the expedition
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
was not to be withstood, and for vows and
renunciations there was always time!...
And now leaning idly on his window ledge
in a spare room of the Embassy, while his
man unpacked, he felt, as he surveyed the
distant dome of the Blue Jesus above the
dwarf-palm trees before the house, half-way
to the East already. He was suffering a
little in his dignity from the contretemps
of his reception, for having arrived at the
Embassy among a jobbed troop of serfs
engaged for the night, Lady Something had
at first mistaken him for one: “The cloak-room
will be in the Smoking-room!” she
had said, and in spite of her laughing excuses
and ample apologies, he could not
easily forget it. What was there in his
appearance that could conceivably recall a
cloak-room attendant&mdash;? <i>He</i> who had been
assured he had the profile of a “Rameses”!
And going to a mirror he scanned, with less
perhaps than his habitual contentment, the
light, liver-tinted hair, grey narrow eyes,
hollow cheeks, and pale mouth like a broken
moon. He was looking just a little fatigued
he fancied from his journey, and really, it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
was all his hostess deserved, if he didn’t go
down.</p>

<p>“I have a headache, Mario,” he told his
man (a Neapolitan who had been attached
to almost as many professions as his master).
“I shall not leave my room! Give me a
kimono: I will take a bath.”</p>

<p>Undressing slowly, he felt as the garments
dropped away, he was acting properly in
refraining from attending the soir&eacute;e, and
only hoped the lesson would not be “lost”
on Lady Something, whom he feared must
be incurably dense.</p>

<p>Lying amid the dissolving bath crystals
while his man-servant deftly bathed him, he
fell into a sort of coma, sweet as a religious
trance. Beneath the rhythmic sponge,
perfumed with <i>Kiki</i>, he was St Sebastian,
and as the water became cloudier and the
crystals evaporated amid the steam, he
was Teresa ... and he would have been,
most likely, the Blessed Virgin herself, but
that the bath grew gradually cold.</p>

<p>“You’re looking a little pale, sir, about
the gills!” the valet solicitously observed,
as he gently dried him.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span></p>

<p>The Hon. ‘Eddy’ winced: “I forbid
you ever to employ the word gill, Mario,”
he exclaimed. “It is inharmonious, and
in English it jars; whatever it may do in
Italian.”</p>

<p>“Overtired, sir, was what I meant to
say.”</p>

<p>“Basta!” his master replied, with all
the brilliant glibness of the Berlitz-school.</p>

<p>Swathed in towels, it was delicious to relax
his powder-blanched limbs upon a comfy
couch, while Mario went for dinner: “I
don’t care what it is! So long as it isn’t&mdash;”(naming
several dishes that he particularly
abhorred, or might be “better,” perhaps,
without)&mdash;” And be sure, fool, not to come
back without Champagne.”</p>

<p>He could not choose but pray that the
Ambassadress had nothing whatever to do
with the Embassy cellar, for from what he
had seen of her already, he had only a slight
opinion of her discernment.</p>

<p>Really he might have been excused had
he taken her to be the cook instead of the
social representative of the Court of St
James, and he was unable to repress a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
caustic smile on recollecting her appearance
that afternoon, with her hat awry,
crammed with <i>Mar&eacute;chal Niel</i> roses, hot,
and decoiffed, flourishing a pair of garden-gauntlets
as she issued her commands.
What a contrast to his own Mamma&mdash;“so
different,” ... and his thoughts returned
to Intriguer&mdash;“dear Intriguer, ...” that
if only to vex his father’s ghost, he would
one day turn into a Jesuit college! The
Confessional should be fitted in the paternal
study, and engravings of the Inquisition, or
the sweet faces of Lippi and Fra Angelico,
replace the Agrarian certificates and tiresome
trophies of the chase; while the crack
of the discipline in Lent would echo
throughout the house! How “useful”
his friend Robbie Renard would have been;
but alas poor Robbie. He had passed
through life at a rapid canter, having died
at nineteen....</p>

<p>Musingly he lit a cigarette.</p>

<p>Through the open window a bee droned
in on the blue air of evening and closing
his eyes he fell to considering whether the
bee of one country would understand the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
remarks of that of another. The effect of the
soil of a nation, had it consequences upon
its Flora? Were plants influenced at their
roots? People sometimes spoke (and
especially ladies) of the language of flowers ... the
pollen therefore of an English
rose would probably vary, not inconsiderably,
from that of a French, and a bee born
and bred at home (at <i>Intriguer</i> for instance)
would be at a loss to understand (it clearly
followed) the conversation of one born and
bred, here, abroad. A bee’s idiom varied
then, as did man’s! And he wondered,
this being proved the case, where the best
bees’ accents were generally acquired....</p>

<p>Opening his eyes, he perceived his former
school chum, Lionel Limpness&mdash;Lord Tiredstock’s
third (and perhaps most gifted) son,
who was an honorary attach&eacute; at the Embassy,
standing over him, his spare figure
already arrayed in an evening suit.</p>

<p>“Sorry to hear you’re off colour, Old
Dear!” he exclaimed, sinking down upon
the couch beside his friend.</p>

<p>“I’m only a little shaken, Lionel...:
have a cigarette.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span></p>

<p>“And so you’re off to Chedorlahomor,
Old Darling?” Lord Tiredstock’s third
son said.</p>

<p>“I suppose so ...” the only son of Lord
Intriguer replied.</p>

<p>“Well, I wish I was going too!”</p>

<p>“It would be charming, Lionel, of course
to have you: but they might appoint you
Vice-Consul at Sodom, or something?”</p>

<p>“Why <i>Vice</i>? Besides...! There’s
no consulate there yet,” Lord Tiredstock’s
third son said, examining the objects upon
the portable altar, draped in prelatial
purple of his friend.</p>

<p>“Turn over, Old Dear, while I chastise
you!” he exclaimed, waving what looked
to be a tortoiseshell lorgnon to which had
been attached three threads of “cerulean”
floss silk.</p>

<p>“Put it down, Lionel, and don’t be
absurd.”</p>

<p>“Over we go. Come on.”</p>

<p>“Really, Lionel.”</p>

<p>“Penitence! To thy knees, Sir!”</p>

<p>And just as it seemed that the only son
of Lord Intriguer was to be deprived of all
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
his towels, the Ambassadress mercifully
entered.</p>

<p>“<i>Poor</i> Mr Monteith!” she exclaimed in
tones of concern bustling forward with a
tablespoon and a bottle containing physic,
“<i>so</i> unfortunate.... Taken ill at the
moment you arrive! But Life is like
that!”</p>

<p>Clad in the flowing circumstance of an
oyster satin ball dress, and all a-glitter like
a Christmas tree (with jewels), her arrival
perhaps saved her guest a “whipping.”</p>

<p>“Had I known, Lady Something, I was
going to be ill, I would have gone to the
Ritz!” the Hon. ‘Eddy’ gasped.</p>

<p>“And you’d have been bitten all over!”
Lady Something replied.</p>

<p>“Bitten all over?”</p>

<p>“The other evening we were dining at the
Palace, and I heard the dear King say&mdash;but
I oughtn’t to talk and excite you&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“By the way, Lady Something,” Lord
Tiredstock’s third son asked: “what is
the etiquette for the Queen of Dateland’s
eunuch?”</p>

<p>“It’s all according; but you had better
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
ask Sir Somebody, Air Limpness,” Lady
Something replied, glancing with interest
at the portable altar.</p>

<p>“I’ve done so, and he declared he’d be
jiggered!”</p>

<p>“I recollect in Pera when we occupied
the Porte, they seemed (those of the old
Grand Vizier&mdash;oh what a good-looking man
he was&mdash;! such eyes&mdash;! and such a <i>way</i>
with him&mdash;! <i>Despot!!</i>) only too thankful
to crouch in corners.”</p>

<p>“Attention with that castor-oil...!”</p>

<p>“It’s not castor-oil; it’s a little decoction
of my own,&mdash;aloes, gregory, a dash of
liquorice. And the rest is buckthorn!”</p>

<p>“Euh!”</p>

<p>“It’s not so bad, though it mayn’t be
very nice.... Toss it off like a brave man,
Mr Monteith (nip his nostrils, Mr Limpness),
and while he takes it, I’ll offer a silent prayer
for him at that duck of an altar,” and as
good as her word, the Ambassadress made
towards it.</p>

<p>“You’re altogether too kind,” the Hon.
‘Eddy’ murmured seeking refuge in a book&mdash;a
volume of <i>Juvenalia</i> published for him
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
by “Blackwood of Oxford,” and becoming
absorbed in its contents: “Ah Doris”&mdash;“Lines
to Doris”&mdash;“Lines to Doris: written
under the influence of wine, sun and fever”&mdash;“Ode
to Swinburne”&mdash;“Sad Tamarisks”&mdash;“Rejection”&mdash;“Doigts
Obsc&egrave;nes”&mdash;“They
Call me <i>Lily</i>!”&mdash;“Land of Titian!
Land of Verdi! Oh Italy!”&mdash;“I heard the
Clock:

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I heard the clock strike seven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seven strokes I heard it strike!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His Lordship’s gone to London<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And won’t be back to-night.”<br /></span>
</span></span>

He had written it at Intriguer, after a
poignant domestic disagreement, his Papa,&mdash;the
“his lordship” of the poem&mdash;had
stayed away however considerably longer....
And here was a sweet thing suggested
by an old Nursery Rhyme, “Loves, have
you Heard”:

<span class="poem"><span class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Loves, have you heard about the rabbits??<br /></span>
<span class="i1">They have such odd fantastic habits....<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Oh, Children...! I daren’t disclose to You<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The licentious things <i>some</i> rabbits do.”<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
</span></span>

It had “come to him” quite suddenly out
ferreting one day with the footman....</p>

<p>But a loud crash as the portable altar
collapsed beneath the weight of the Ambassadress
aroused him unpleasantly from
his thoughts.</p>

<p>“Horrid dangerous thing!” she exclaimed
as Lord Tiredstock’s third son
assisted her to rise from her “Silent”
prayer: “I had no idea it wasn’t solid!
But Life is like that ...” she added
somewhat wildly.</p>

<p>“Pity oh my God! Deliver me!” the
Hon. ‘Eddy’ breathed, but the hour of
<i>deliverance</i> it seemed was not just yet; for
at that instant the Hon. Mrs Chilleywater,
the “literary” wife of the first attach&eacute;,
thrust her head in at the door.</p>

<p>“How are you?” she asked. “I
thought perhaps I might find <i>Harold</i>....”</p>

<p>“He’s with Sir Somebody.”</p>

<p>“Such mysteries!” Lady Something said.</p>

<p>“This betrothal of Princess Elsie’s is
simply wearing him out,” Mrs Chilleywater
declared, sweeping the room with half-closed,
expressionless eyes.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span></p>

<p>“It’s a pity you can’t pull the strings
for us,” Lady Something ventured: “I
was saying so lately to Sir Somebody.”</p>

<p>“I wish I could, dear Lady Something:
I wouldn’t mind wagering I’d soon bring it
off!”</p>

<p>“Have you fixed up Grace Gillstow
yet, Mrs Chilleywater?” Lord Tiredstock’s
third son asked.</p>

<p>“She shall marry Baldwin: but not
before she has been seduced first by
Barnaby....”</p>

<p>“What are you talking about?” the
Hon. ‘Eddy’ queried.</p>

<p>“Of Mrs Chilleywater’s forthcoming
book.”</p>

<p>“Why should Barnaby get Grace&mdash;?
Why not Tex!”</p>

<p>But Mrs Chilleywater refused to enter
into reasons.</p>

<p>“She is looking for cowslips,” she said,
“and oh I’ve such a wonderful description
of a field of cowslips.... They make quite
a darling setting for a powerful scene of lust.”</p>

<p>“So Grace loses her virtue!..!” Lord
Tiredstock’s third son exclaimed.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span></p>

<p>“Even so she’s far too good for Baldwin:
after the underhand shabby way he behaved
to Charlotte, Kate, and Millicent!”</p>

<p>“Life is like that, dear,” the Ambassadress
blandly observed.</p>

<p>“It ought not to be, Lady Something!”
Mrs Chilleywater looked vindictive.</p>

<p><i>N&eacute;e</i> Victoria Gellybore Frinton, and the
sole heir of Lord Seafairer of Sevenelms,
Kent, Mrs Harold Chilleywater, since her
marriage “for Love,” had developed a disconcerting
taste for fiction&mdash;a taste that
was regarded at the Foreign Office with
disapproving forbearance.... So far her
efforts (written under her maiden name in
full with her husband’s as well appended)
had been confined to lurid studies of low
life (of which she knew nothing at all), but
the Hon. Harold Chilleywater had been
gently warned, that if he was not to remain
at Kairoulla until the close of his career, the
style of his wife must really grow less <i>virile</i>.</p>

<p>“I agree with V.G.F.,” the Hon. Lionel
Limpness murmured fondling meditatively
his “Charlie Chaplin” moustache&mdash;“Life
ought not to be.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span></p>

<p>“It’s a mistake to bother oneself over
matters that can’t be remedied.”</p>

<p>Mrs Chilleywater acquiesced: “You’re
right indeed, Lady Something,” she said,
“but I’m so sensitive.... I seem to <i>know</i>
when I talk to a man, the colour of his
braces...! I say to myself: ‘Yours
are violet....’   ‘Yours are blue....’
‘His are red....’”</p>

<p>“I’ll bet you anything, Mrs Chilleywater,
you like, you won’t guess what mine are,”
the Hon. Lionel Limpness said.</p>

<p>“I should say, Mr Limpness, that they
were <i>multihued</i>&mdash;like Jacob’s,” Mrs Chilleywater
replied, as she withdrew her head.</p>

<p>The Ambassadress prepared to follow:</p>

<p>“Come, Mr Limpness,” she exclaimed,
“we’ve exhausted the poor fellow quite
enough&mdash;and besides, here comes his
dinner.”</p>

<p>“Open the champagne, Mario,” his
master commanded immediately they were
alone.</p>

<p>“‘Small’ beer is all the butler would
allow, sir.”</p>

<p>“Damn the b... butler!”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span></p>

<p>“What he calls a <i>demi-brune</i>, sir. In
Naples we say <i>spumenti</i>!”</p>

<p>“To &mdash;&mdash; with it.”</p>

<p>“Non &eacute; tanto amarro, sir; it’s more
sharp, as you’d say, than bitter....”</p>

<p>“......!!!!!!”</p>

<p>And language <i>unmonastic</i> far into the
night reigned supreme.</p>

<p>Standing beneath the portraits of King
Geo and Queen Glory, Lady Something,
behind a large sheaf of mauve malmaisons,
was growing stiff. Already, for the most
part, the guests were welcomed, and it was
only the Archduchess now, who as usual
was late, that kept their Excellencies lingering
at the head of the stairs. Her Majesty
Queen Thleeanouhee of the Land of Dates
had just arrived, but seemed loath to leave
the stairs, while her hostess, whom she
addressed affectionately as her <i>dear gazelle</i>,
remained upon them&mdash; “Let us go away by
and by, my dear gazelle,” she exclaimed
with a primitive smile, “and remove our
corsets and talk.”</p>

<p>“Unhappily Pisuerga is not the East,
ma’am!” Lady Something replied.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span></p>

<p>“Never mind, my dear; we will introduce
this innovation....”</p>

<p>But the arrival of the Archduchess Elizabeth
spared the Ambassadress from what
might too easily have become an “incident.”</p>

<p>In the beautiful chandeliered apartments
several young couples were pirouetting to
the inevitable waltz from the Blue Banana,
but most of the guests seemed to prefer
exploring the conservatories and Winter
Garden, or elbowing their way into a little
room where a new portrait of Princess Elsie
had been discreetly placed....</p>

<p>“One feels, of course, there <i>was</i> a sitting&mdash;;
but still, it isn’t like her!” those that had
seen her said.</p>

<p>“The artist has attributed to her at least
the pale spent eyes of her father!” the
Duchess of Cavaljos remarked to her niece,
who was standing quite silent against a
rose-red curtain.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle de Nazianzi made no reply.
Attaching not the faintest importance to
the rumours afloat, still, she could not but
feel, at times, a little heartshaken....</p>

<p>The duchess plied her fan.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span></p>

<p>“She will become florid in time like her
mother!” she cheerfully predicted turning
away just as the Archduchess approached
herself to inspect the painting.</p>

<p>Swathed in furs, on account of a troublesome
cough contracted paddling, she
seemed nevertheless in charming spirits.</p>

<p>“Have you been to my new <i>Pipi</i>?”
she asked.</p>

<p>“Not yet&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh but you must!”</p>

<p>“I’m told it’s even finer than the one
at the Railway Station. Ah, from musing
too long on that Hellenic frieze, how often
I’ve missed my train!” the Duchess of
Cavaljos murmured, with a little fat deep
laugh.</p>

<p>“I have a heavenly idea for another&mdash;Yellow
tiles with Thistles....”</p>

<p>“Your Royal Highness never repeats
herself!”</p>

<p>“Nothing will satisfy me this time,” the
Archduchess declared, “but files of state-documents
in all the dear little boxes: In
secret, secrets!” she added archly fixing
her eyes on the assembly.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span></p>

<p>“It’s positively pitiable,” the Duchess
of Cavaljos commented, “how the Countess
of Tolga is losing her good-looks: She has
the air to-night of a tired business-woman!”</p>

<p>“She looks at other women as though
she would inhale them,” the Archduchess
answered, throwing back her furs with a
gesture of superb grace, in order to allow
her robe to be admired by a lady who was
scribbling busily away behind a door, with
little nervous lifts of the head. For
<i>noblesse oblige</i> the correspondent of the
<i>Jaw-Waw</i>, the illustrious Eva Schnerb,
was not to be denied.</p>

<p>“Among the many balls of a brilliant
season,” the diarist, with her accustomed
fluency, wrote: “none surpassed that
which I witnessed at the English Embassy
last night. I sat in a corner of the Winter
Garden and literally gorged myself upon
the display of dazzling uniforms and jewels.
The Ambassadress Lady Something was
looking really regal in dawn-white draperies,
holding a bouquet of the new mauve malmaisons
(which are all the vogue just now),
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
but no one, I thought, looked better than the
<i>Archduchess</i>, etc.... Helping the hostess,
I noticed Mrs Harold Chilleywater, in an
‘&aelig;sthetic’ gown of flame-hued Kanitra
silk edged with Armousky fur (to possess a
dear woolly Armousk as a pet, is considered
<i>chic</i> this season), while over her brain&mdash;an
intellectual caprice, I wonder?&mdash;I saw a
tinsel bow.... She is a daughter of the
fortieth Lord Seafairer of Sevenelms-Park
(so famous for its treasures) and is very
artistic and literary having written several
novels of English life under her maiden
name of Victoria Gellybore-Frinton:&mdash;She
inherits considerable cleverness <i>also</i> from
her Mother. Dancing indefatigably (as
she always does!) Miss Ivy Something
seemed to be thoroughly enjoying her
Father’s ball: I hear on <i>excellent authority</i>
there is no foundation in the story of her
engagement to a certain young Englishman,
said to be bound ere long for the ruins of
Sodom and Gomorrah. Among the late
arrivals were the Duke and Duchess of
Varna&mdash;<i>she</i> all in golden tissues: they
came together with Madame Wetme, who
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
is one of the new hostesses of the season
you know, and they say has bought the
Duke of Varna’s palatial town-house in
Samaden Square&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“There,” the Archduchess murmured,
drawing her wraps about her with a sneeze:
“she has said quite enough now I think
about my <i>toilette</i>!”</p>

<p>But the illustrious Eva was in unusual
fettle, and only closed her notebook towards
Dawn, when the nib of her pen caught fire.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span></p>

<h2 id="VI">VI</h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">And</span> suddenly the Angel of Death
passed by and the brilliant season
waned. In the Archduchess’ bed-chamber,
watching the antics of priests and
doctors, he sat there unmoved. Propped
high, by many bolsters, in a vast blue
canopied bed, the Archduchess lay staring
laconically at a diminutive model of a flight
of steps, leading to what appeared to be intended,
perhaps, as a hall of Attent, off which
opened quite a lot of little doors, most of
which bore the word: “Engaged.” A doll,
with a ruddy face, in charge, smiled indolently
as she sat feigning knitting, suggesting
vague “fleshly thoughts,” whenever he looked
up, in the Archduchess’ spiritual adviser.</p>

<p>And the mind of the sinking woman,
as her thoughts wandered, appeared to be
tinged with “matter” too: “I recollect
the first time I heard the <i>Blue-Danube</i>
played!” she broke out: “it was at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
Schonnbrunn&mdash;sch&ouml;nes Schonnbrunn&mdash;My
cousin Ludwig of Bavaria came&mdash;I wore&mdash;the
Emperor said&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“If your royal highness would swallow
this!” Dr Cuncliffe Babcock started forward
with a glass.</p>

<p>“Trinquons, trinquons et vive l’amour!
Schneider sang that&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“If your royal highness&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Ah my dear Vienna. Where’s Teddywegs?”</p>

<p>At the Archduchess’ little escritoire at
the foot of the bed, her Dreaminess was
making ready a few private telegrams,
breaking without undue harshness the
melancholy news: “Poor Lizzie has ceased
articulating,” she did not think she could
improve on it, and indeed had written it
several times in her most temperamental
hand, when the Archduchess had started
suddenly cackling about Vienna.</p>

<p>“<i>Ssssh</i>, Lizzie&mdash;I never can write when
people talk!”</p>

<p>“I want Teddywegs.”</p>

<p>“The Countess Yvorra took him for a
run round the courtyard.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span></p>

<p>“I think I must undertake a convenience
next for dogs.... It is disgraceful they
have not got one already, poor creatures,”
the Archduchess crooned accepting the
proffered glass.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, dear,” the Queen exclaimed
rising and crossing to the window.</p>

<p>The bitter odour of the oleander flowers
outside oppressed the breathless air and
filled the room as with a faint funereal
music. So still a day. Tending the
drooping sun-saturated flowers, a gardener
with long ivory arms alone seemed animate.</p>

<p>“Pull up your skirt, Marquise! Pull it
up.... It’s dragging, a little, in the water.”</p>

<p>“<i>Judica me, Deus</i>,” in imperious tones,
the priest by the bedside besought: “<i>et
discerne causam meum de gente non sancta.
Parce, Domine! Parce populo tuo&mdash;! ne
in aeternum irascaris nobis</i>.”</p>

<p>“A whale! A whale!”</p>

<p>“<i>Sustinuit anima mea in verbo ejus
speravit anima mea in Domino.</i>”</p>

<p>“Elsie?” A look of wondrous happiness
overspread the Archduchess’ face&mdash;She
was wading&mdash;wading again among
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
the irises and rushes; wading, her hand in
Princess Elsie’s hand, through a glittering
golden sea, towards the wide horizon.</p>

<p>The plangent cry of a peacock, rose
disquietingly from the garden.</p>

<p>“I’m nothing but nerves, doctor,” her
Dreaminess lamented, fidgeting with the
crucifix that dangled at her neck upon a
chain. <i>Ultra</i> feminine, she disliked that
another&mdash;even <i>in extremis</i>&mdash;should absorb
<i>all</i> the limelight.</p>

<p>“A change of scene, ma’am, would be
probably beneficial,” Dr Cuncliffe Babcock
replied, eyeing askance the Countess of
Tolga who unobtrusively entered:</p>

<p>“The couturiers attend your pleasure,
ma’am,” in impassive undertones she said:
“to fit your mourning.”</p>

<p>“Oh tell them the Queen is too tired to
try on now,” her Dreaminess answered
repairing in agitation towards a glass.</p>

<p>“They would come here, ma’am,” the
Countess said, pointing persuasively to the
little anteroom of the Archduchess, where
two nuns of the Flaming-Hood were industriously
telling their beads.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span></p>

<p>“&mdash;&mdash;I don’t know why, but this glass
refuses to flatter me!”</p>

<p>“<i>Benedicamus Domino! Ostende nobis
Domine misericordiam tuam. Et salutare
tuum da nobis!</i>”</p>

<p>“Well just a toque,” the Queen sadly
assented.</p>

<p>“<i>Indulgentiam absolutionem et remissionem
peccatorum nostrorum tribuat nobis
omnipotens et misericors Dominus.</i>”</p>

<p>“Guess who is at the Ritz, ma’am, this
week!” the Countess demurely murmured.</p>

<p>“Who is at the Ritz this week, I can’t,”
the Queen replied.</p>

<p>“<i>Nobody!</i>”</p>

<p>“Why how so?”</p>

<p>“The Ambassadress of England, it
seems has alarmed the world away. I
gather they mean to prosecute!”</p>

<p>The Archduchess sighed.</p>

<p>“I want mauve sweet-peas,” she listlessly
said.</p>

<p>“Her spirit soars; her thoughts are
in the <i>Champs-Elys&eacute;es</i>,” the Countess exclaimed,
withdrawing noiselessly to warn
the milliners.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span></p>

<p>“Or in the garden,” the Queen reflected,
returning to the window. And she was
standing there, her eyes fixed half wistfully
upon the long ivory arms of the kneeling
gardener, when the Angel of Death (who
had sat unmoved throughout the day)
arose.</p>

<p>It was decided to fix a period of mourning
of fourteen days for the late Archduchess.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span></p>

<h2 id="VII">VII</h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">Swans</span> and sunlight. A little fishing
boat with coral sails. A lake
all grey and green. Beatitude
intense. Consummate calm. It was nice
to be at the Summer-Palace after all.</p>

<p>“The way the air will catch your cheek
and make a rose of it,” the Countess of
Tolga breathed. And as none of the
company heeded her: “How sweetly the
air takes one’s cheek,” she sighed again.</p>

<p>The post-prandial exercise of the members
of the Court through the palace grounds
was almost an institution.</p>

<p>The first half of the mourning prescribed,
had as yet not run its course, but the
tongues of the Queen’s ladies had long since
made an end of it.</p>

<p>“I hate dancing with a fat man,” Mademoiselle
de Nazianzi was saying: “for if
you dance at all near him, his stomach hits
you, while if you pull away, you catch
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
either the scent of his breath or the hair of
his beard.”</p>

<p>“But, you innocent baby, <i>all</i> big men
haven’t beards,” Countess Medusa Rappa
remarked.</p>

<p>“Haven’t they? Never mind. Everything’s
so beautiful,” the young girl
inconsequently exclaimed: “Look at that
Thistle! and that Bee! O, you darling!”</p>

<p>“Ah, how one’s face unbends in
gardens!” the Countess of Tolga said,
regarding the scene before her, with a faraway
pensive glance.</p>

<p>Along the lake’s shore, sheltered from
the winds by a ring of wooded hills, shewed
many a proud retreat, mirroring its marble
terraces to the waveless waters of the lake.</p>

<p>Beneath a twin-peaked crag (known
locally as the White Mountain whose
slopes frequently would burst forth into
patches of garlic that from the valley resembled
snow) nestled the Villa Clement,
rented each season by the Ambassador of
the Court of St James, while half-screened
by conifers and rhododendrons, and in the
lake itself, was St Helena&mdash;the home and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
place of retirement of a “fallen” minister
of the Crown.</p>

<p>Countess Medusa Rappa cocked her sunshade;
“Whose boat is that,” she asked,
“with the azure oars?”</p>

<p>“It looks nothing but a pea-pod!” the
Countess of Tolga declared.</p>

<p>“It belongs to a darling, with delicious
lips and eyes like brown chestnuts,”
Mademoiselle de Lamb&egrave;se informed.</p>

<p>“Ah!... Ah!... Ah!... Ah!...”
her colleagues crooned.</p>

<p>“A sailor?”</p>

<p>The Queen’s maid nodded: “There’s a
partner, though,” she added, “A blue-eyed,
gashed-cheeked angel....”</p>

<p>Mademoiselle de Nazianzi looked away.</p>

<p>“I love the lake with the white wandering
ships,” she sentimentally stated, descrying
in the distance the prince.</p>

<p>It was usually towards this time, the
hour of the siesta, that the lovers would
meet and taste their happiness, but, to-day,
it seemed ordained otherwise.</p>

<p>Before the heir apparent had determined
whether to advance or retreat, his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
father and mother were upon him, attended
by two dowagers newly lunched.</p>

<p>“The song of the pilgrim women, how
it haunts me,” one of the dowagers was
holding forth: “I could never tire of that
beautiful, beautiful music! Never tire of
it. Ne-ver....”</p>

<p>“Ta, ta, ta, ta,” the Queen vociferated
girlishly, slipping her arm affectionately
through that of her son’s.</p>

<p>“How spent you look, my boy.... Those
eyes....”</p>

<p>His Weariness grimaced.</p>

<p>“They’ve just been rubbing in Elsie!”
he said.</p>

<p>“Who?”</p>

<p>“‘Vasleine’ and ‘Nanny-goat’!”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“Nothing will shake me.”</p>

<p>“What are your objections?”</p>

<p>“She’s so extraordinarily uninteresting!”</p>

<p>“Oh Yousef!” his mother faltered:
“<i>Do you wish to break my heart</i>?”</p>

<p>“We had always thought you too
lacking in initiative,” King William said
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
(tucking a few long hairs back into his
nose) “to marry against our wishes.”</p>

<p>“They say she walks too wonderfully,”
the Queen courageously pursued.</p>

<p>“What? Well?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Thank God for it.”</p>

<p>“And can handle a horse as few others
can!”</p>

<p>Prince Yousef closed his eyes.</p>

<p>He had not forgotten how as an undergraduate
in England he had come upon the
princess once while out with the hounds.
And it was only by a consummate effort
that he was able to efface the sinister
impression she had made&mdash;her lank hair
falling beneath a man’s felt-hat, her habit
skirt torn to tatters, her full cheeks
smeared in blood; the blood, so it seemed,
of her “first” fox.</p>

<p>A shudder seized him.</p>

<p>“No, nothing can possibly shake me,”
he murmured again.</p>

<p>With a detached, cold face, the Queen
paused to inhale a rose.</p>

<p>(Oh you gardens of Palaces...! How
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
often have you witnessed agitation and
disappointment? You smooth, adorned
paths...! How often have you known
the extremes of care...?)</p>

<p>“It would be better to do away I think
next year with that bed of cinerarias
altogether,” the Queen of Pisuerga remarked,
“since persons won’t go round it.”</p>

<p>Traversing the flower plat now, with the
air of a black-beetle with a purpose, was
the Countess Yvorra.</p>

<p>“We had supposed you higher-principled,
Countess,” her sovereign admonished.</p>

<p>The Countess slightly flushed.</p>

<p>“I’m looking for groundsel for my birds,
Sire,” she said&mdash;“for my little dickies!”</p>

<p>“We understand your boudoir is a sort
of menagerie,” His Majesty affirmed.</p>

<p>The Countess tittered.</p>

<p>“Animals love me,” she archly professed.
“Birds perch on my breast if only I wave....
The other day a sweet red robin came
and stayed for hours...!”</p>

<p>“The Court looks to you to set a high
example,” the Queen declared, focusing
quizzically a marble shape of Leda green
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
with moss, for whose time-corroded plinth
the late Archduchess’ toy-terrier was just
then shewing a certain contempt.</p>

<p>The Countess’ long, slightly pulpy fingers
strayed nervously towards the rosary at her
thigh.</p>

<p>“With your majesty’s consent,” she said,
“I propose a campaign to the Island.”</p>

<p>“What? And beard the Count?”</p>

<p>“The salvation of one so fallen, in my
estimation should be worth hereafter (at
the present rate of exchange, but the values
vary) ... a Plenary perpetual-indulgence:
I therefore,” the Countess said, with an
upward fleeting glance (and doubtless guileless
of intention of irony), “feel it my <i>duty</i>
to do what I can.”</p>

<p>“I trust you will take a bodyguard
when you go to St Helena?”</p>

<p>“And pray tell Count Cabinet from us,”
the King looked implacable: “we forbid
him to serenade the Court this year! or
to throw himself into the Lake again or to
make himself a nuisance!”</p>

<p>“He was over early this morning,
Willie,” the Queen retailed: “I saw him
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
from a window. Fishing, or feigning to!
And with white kid gloves, and a red
carnation.”</p>

<p>“Let us catch him stepping ashore!”
the King displayed displeasure.</p>

<p>“And as usual the same mignon youth
had the charge of the tiller.”</p>

<p>“I could tell a singular story of that
young man,” the Countess said: “for he
was once a choir-boy at the Blue Jesus.
But, perhaps, I would do better to spare
your ears....”</p>

<p>“You would do better, a good deal, to
spare my cinerarias,” her Dreaminess
murmured, sauntering slowly on.</p>

<p>Sun so bright, trees so green, it was a
perfect day. Through the glittering fronds
of the palms shone the lake like a floor of
silver glass strewn with white sails.</p>

<p>“It’s odd,” the King observed, giving the
dog Teddywegs a sly prod with his cane,
“how he follows Yousef.”</p>

<p>“He seems to know!” the Queen
replied.</p>

<p>A remark that so annoyed the Prince
that he curtly left the garden.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span></p>

<h2 id="VIII">VIII</h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">But</span> this melancholy period of <i>cr&ecirc;pe</i>,
a time of idle secrets, and unbosomings,
was to prove fatal to the
happiness of Mademoiselle de Nazianzi.
She now heard she was not the first in the
Prince’s life, and that most of the Queen’s
maids, indeed, had had identical experiences
with her own. She furthermore
learned, amid ripples of laughter, of her
lover’s relations with the Marquesa Pizzi-Parma
and of his light dealings with the
dancer April Flowers, a negress (to what
depths??) at a time when he was enjoying
the waxen favours of the wife of his
Magnificence, the Master of the Horse.</p>

<p>Chilled to the point of numbness, the
mortified girl had scarcely winced, and
when on repairing to her room a little later,
she had found his Weariness wandering in
the corridor on the chance of a surreptitious
kiss, she had bolted past him without
look, or word, and sharply closed her door.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span></p>

<p>The Court had returned to colours when
she opened it again, and such had been the
trend of her meditations, that her initial steps
were directed, with deliberate austerity,
towards the basilica of the Palace.</p>

<p>Except for the Countess Yvorra, with an
<i>&eacute;charpe de d&eacute;cence</i> drawn over her hair,
there was no one in it.</p>

<p>“I thank Thee God for this <i>escape</i>,” she
murmured falling to her knees before the
silver branches of a cross: “It is terrible;
for I did so love him .........................
...............................................
...............................................
...... and oh how could he ever with <i>a
negress</i>? .......................................
................................................
...... Pho .....................................
........... I fear this complete upset has
considerably aged me............................
....... But to Thee I cling...................
................................................
................................................
Preserve me at all times from the toils of
the wicked, and forgive him, as <i>I</i> hope to
forgive him soon.” Then kindling several
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
candles with a lingering hand, she shaped
her course towards the Kennels, called
Teddywegs to her and started, with an
aching heart, for a walk.</p>

<p>It was a day of heavy somnolence. Skirting
the Rosery where gardeners with their
slowly moving rakes were tending the sandy
paths, she chose a neglected footway that descended
towards the lake. Indifferent to the
vivacity of Teddywegs, who would race on
a little before her, then wait with leonine
accouchments of head until she had almost
reached him, when he would prick an ear and
spring forward with a yap of exhortation, she
proceeded leisurely, and with many a pause,
wrapped in her own mournful thoughts.</p>

<p>Alack! Among the court circle there
was no one to whom in her disillusion she
could look for solace, and her spirit yearned
for Sister Ursula, and the Convent of the
Flaming-Hood.</p>

<p>Wending her way amid the tall trees, she
felt she had never cared for Yousef as she
had for Ursula ... and broodingly, in order
to ease her heart, she began comparing
the two together as she walked along.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span></p>

<p>After all what had he ever said that
was not either commonplace or foolish?
Whereas Sister Ursula’s talk was invariably
pointed; and often indeed so delicately,
that words seemed almost too crude a
medium to convey her ethereal meanings,
and she would move her evocative hands,
and flash her aura, and it was no fault of
hers if you hadn’t a peep of the beyond.
And the infinite tenderness of her least
caress. Yousef’s lips had seldom conveyed
to hers the spell of Ursula’s; and once indeed
lately, when he had kissed her, there
had been an unsavoury aroma of tobacco
and <i>charcuterie</i>, which, to deal with, had required
both tact and courage.... Ah dear
Hood! What harmony life had held within.
Unscrupulous and deceiving men might lurk
around its doors (they often did) coveting
the chaste, but Old Jane, the porteress, would
open to no man beyond the merest crack.
And how right they were the nuns in their
mistrust of man! Sister Ursula one day had
declared, in uplifted mood, that “marriage
was obscene.” Was it&mdash;? ...?? ... Perhaps
it might be&mdash;! How appalling if it was!
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span></p>

<p>She had reached the lake.</p>

<p>Beneath a sky as white as platinum it
lay, pearly, dove-like, scintillating capriciously
where a heat-shrouded sun kindled
its torpid waters into fleeting diamonds. A
convulsive breeze strayed gratefully from the
opposite shore, descending from the hills that
rose up all veiled, and without detail, against
the brilliant whiteness of the morning.</p>

<p>Sinking down upon the shingle by an
upturned boat, she heaved a brief sigh, and
drawing from her vanity-case the last
epistles of the Prince, she began methodically
to arrange them in their proper sequence.</p>

<p>(<i>1</i>) “What is the matter with my Dearest
Girl?”</p>

<p>(<i>2</i>) “My own tender little Lita, I do not
understand&mdash;”</p>

<p>(<i>3</i>) “Darling, what’s this&mdash;?”</p>

<p>(<i>4</i>) “Beloved one, I swear&mdash;”</p>

<p>(<i>5</i>) “Your cruel silence&mdash;”</p>

<p>If published in a dainty brochure format
about the time of his Coronation, they ought to
realise no contemptible sum, and the proceeds
might go to Charity, she reflected, thrusting
them back again carefully into the bag.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span></p>

<p>Then, finding the shingle too hard through
her thin gown to remain seated long, she got
up, and ran a mournful race with Teddywegs
along the shore.</p>

<p>Not far along the lake was the “village,”
with the H&ocirc;tel d’Angleterre et du Lac,
its stucco, belettered-walls professing:
“Garages, Afternoon Tea, Modern Comfort!”
Flitting by this, and the unpretentious
pier (where long, blonde fishing-nets
lay drying in the sun), it was a relief to
reach the remoter plage beyond.</p>

<p>Along the banks stretched vast brown
carpets of corn and rye, broken by an occasional
olive-garth, beneath whose sparse
shade the heavy-eyed oxen blinked and
whisked their tails, under the attacks of
the water-gnats that were swarming around.</p>

<p>Musing on Negresses&mdash;and Can-Can
dancers in particular&mdash;she strolled along a
strand all littered with shells and little
jewel-like stones.</p>

<p>The sun shone down more fiercely now,
and soon, for freshness sake, she was obliged
to take to the fields.</p>

<p>Passing among the silver drooping olives,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
relieved here and there by a stone-pine,
or slender cypress-tree eternally green, she
sauntered on, often lured aside to pluck
the radiant wild-flowers by the way. On
the banks the pinkest cyclamens were in
bloom, and cornflowers of the hue of paradise,
and fine-stemmed poppies flecked
with pink.</p>

<p>“Pho! A Negress ...” she murmured,
following the flight of some waterfowl
towards the opposite shore.</p>

<p>The mists had fallen from the hills,
revealing old woods wrapped in the blue
doom of Summer.</p>

<p>Beyond those glowing heights, towards
this hour, the nuns, each in her cool,
shuttered, cell, would be immersed in
noontide prayer.</p>

<p>“Ursula&mdash;for thee!” she sighed, proffering
her bouquet in the direction of the town.</p>

<p>A loud splash ... the sight of a pair of delicate
legs (mocking the Law’s requirements
under the Modesty Act as relating to bathers)....
Mademoiselle de Nazianzi turned and
fled. She had recognised <i>the Prince</i>.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span></p>

<h2 id="IX">IX</h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">And</span> in this difficult time of spiritual
distress, made more trying perhaps
because of the blazing midsummer
days, and long, pent feverish nights,
Mademoiselle de Nazianzi turned in her
tribulation towards religion.</p>

<p>The Ecclesiastical set at Court, composed
of some six, or so, ex-Circes, under the command
of the Countess Yvorra, were only
too ready to welcome her, and invitations
to meet Monsignor this, or “Father” that,
who constantly were being <i>coaxed</i> from their
musty sacristies and wan-faced acolytes in
the capital, in order that they might officiate
at Masses, Confessions and Breakfast-parties
<i>&agrave; la fourchette</i>, were lavished daily
upon the bewildered girl.</p>

<p>Messages, and hasty informal lightly-pencilled
notes, too, would frequently reach
her; such as: “I shall be pouring out
cocoa after dinner in bed. Bring your
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
biscuits and join me!” ... or a rat-a-tat
from a round-eyed page and: “The
Countess’ comp’ts and she’d take it a
Favour if you can make a ‘Station’ with her
in chapel later on,” or: “The Marchioness
will be birched to-morrow, and <i>not</i> to-day.”</p>

<p>O, the charm, the flavour of the religious
world! Where match it for interest or
variety!</p>

<p>An emotion approaching sympathy had
arisen, perhaps a trifle incongruously, between
the injured girl and the Countess
Yvorra, and before long, to the amusement
of the sceptical element of the Court, the
Countess and her Confessor, Father Nostradamus,
might often be observed in her
society.</p>

<p>“I need a cage-companion, Father, for
my little bird,” the Countess one evening
said, as they were ambling, all the three of
them before Office up and down the perfectly
tended paths: “ought it to be of the
same species and sex, or does it matter? For
as I said to myself just now (while listening
to a thrush), <i>All</i> birds are His creatures.”</p>

<p>The priest discreetly coughed.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span></p>

<p>“Your question requires reflection,” he
said: “What is the bird?”</p>

<p>“A hen canary!&mdash;and with a voice,
Father! Talk of soul!!”</p>

<p>“H&mdash;m ... a thrush and a canary, I
would not myself advise.”</p>

<p>Mademoiselle de Nazianzi tittered.</p>

<p>“Why not let it go?” she asked, turning
her eyes towards the window-panes of
the palace, that glanced like rows of beaten-gold
in the evening sun.</p>

<p>“A hawk might peck it!” the Countess
returned, looking up as if for one, into a sky
as imaginative, and as dazzling as Shelley
poetry.</p>

<p>“Even the Court,” Father Nostradamus
ejaculated wryly, “will peck at times.”</p>

<p>The Countess’ shoulder-blades stiffened.</p>

<p>“After over thirty years,” she said, “I
find Court-life <i>pathetic</i>....”</p>

<p>“Pathetic?”</p>

<p>“Tragically pathetic....”</p>

<p>Mademoiselle de Nazianzi considered
wistfully the wayward outline of the hills.</p>

<p>“I would like to escape from it all for a
while,” she said, “and travel.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span></p>

<p>“I must hunt you out a pamphlet, by
and by, dear child, on the ‘Dangers of
Wanderlust.’”</p>

<p>“The Great Wall of China and the Bay
of Naples! It seems so frightful never to
have seen them!”</p>

<p>“I have never seen the Great Wall,
either,” the Countess said, “and I don’t
suppose, my dear, I ever shall; though I
once did spend a fortnight in Italy.”</p>

<p>“Tell me about it.”</p>

<p>The Countess became reminiscent.</p>

<p>“In Venice,” she said, “the indecent
movements of the Gondolieri quite affected
my health, and, in consequence, I fell a prey
to a sharp nervous fever. My temperature
rose and it rose, ah, yes ... until I became
quite ill. At last I said to my maid (she
was an English girl from <i>Wales</i>, and almost
equally as sensitive as me): ‘Pack....
Away!’ And we left in haste for Florence.
Ah, and Florence, too, I regret to say I
found very far from what it ought to have
been!!! I had a window giving on the
Arno, and so I could <i>observe</i>.... I used to
see some curious sights! I would not care
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
to scathe your ears, my Innocent, by an inventory
of one half of the wantonness that
went on; enough to say the tone of the
place forced me to fly to Rome, where beneath
the shadow of dear St Peter’s I grew
gradually less distressed.”</p>

<p>“Still, I should like, all the same, to
travel!” Mademoiselle de Nazianzi exclaimed,
with a sad little snatch of a smile.</p>

<p>“We will ask the opinion of Father
Geordie Picpus, when he comes again.”</p>

<p>“It would be more fitting,” Father Nostradamus
murmured (professional rivalry
leaping to his eye), “if Father Picpus kept
himself free of the limelight a trifle more!”</p>

<p>“Often I fear our committees would be
corv&eacute;s without him....”</p>

<p>“Tchut.”</p>

<p>“He is very popular ... too popular,
perhaps ...” the Countess admitted. “I
remember on one occasion in the Blue
Jesus, witnessing the Duchess of Quaranta
and Madame Ferdinand Fishbacher, fight
like wild cats as to which should gain his
ear&mdash;(any girl might envy Father Geordie
his ear)&mdash;at Confession next. The odds
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
seemed fairly equal, until the Duchess gave
the Fishbacher-woman, such a violent push&mdash;(well
down from behind, in the crick of
the joints)&mdash;that she overturned The Confessional
Box, with Father Picpus within:
and when we scared ladies, standing by,
had succeeded in dragging him out, he was
too shaken, naturally as you can gather, to
absolve anyone else <i>that</i> day.”</p>

<p>“He has been the object of so many
unseemly incidents, that one can scarcely
recall them all,” Father Nostradamus
exclaimed, stooping to pick up a dropped
pocket-handkerchief with “remembrance”
knots tied to three of the corners.</p>

<p>“Alas.... Court life is not uplifting,”
the Countess said again, contemplating her
muff of <i>self-made</i> lace, with a half-vexed
forehead. What that muff contained was
a constant problem for conjecture; but it
was believed by more than one of the maids-in-waiting
to harbour “goody” books and
martyrs’ bones.</p>

<p>“By generous deeds and Brotherly love,”
Father Nostradamus exclaimed, “we should
endeavour to rise above it!”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span></p>

<p>With the deftness of a virtuoso, the
Countess seized, and crushed with her muff,
a pale-winged passing gnat.</p>

<p>“Before Life,” she murmured, “that
saddest thing of all, was thrust upon us, I
believe I was an angel....”</p>

<p>Father Nostradamus passed a musing
hand across his brow.</p>

<p>“It may be,” he replied, “and it very
well may be,” he went on, “that our ante-nativity
was a little more brilliant, a little
more <i>h&mdash;m</i> ...; and there is nothing unorthodox
in thinking so.”</p>

<p>“O what did I do then to lose my wings??
What did I ever say to Them?! Father,
Father. How did I annoy God? Why
did He put me here?”</p>

<p>“My dear child, you ask me things I do
not know; but it may be you were the instrument
appointed above to lead back to
Him our neighbour yonder,” Father Nostradamus
answered, pointing with his
breviary in the direction of St Helena.</p>

<p>“Never speak to me of that wretched
old man.”</p>

<p>For despite the ablest tactics, the most
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
diplomatic angling, Count Cabinet had
refused to rally.</p>

<p>“We followed the sails of your skiff
to-day,” Mademoiselle de Nazianzi sighed,
“until the hazes hid them!”</p>

<p>“I had a lilac passage.”</p>

<p>“You delivered the books?”</p>

<p>The Countess shrugged.</p>

<p>“I shall never forget this afternoon,” she
said. “He was sitting in the window over
a decanter of wine when I floated down
upon him; but no sooner did he see me,
than he gave a sound, like a bleat of a goat,
and disappeared: I was determined however
to call! There is no bell to the villa,
but two bronze door-knockers, well out of
reach, are attached to the front-door.
These with the ferrule of my parasol I
tossed and I rattled, until an adolescent,
with Bougainvillea at his ear, came and
looked out with an insolent grin, and I
recognised Peter Passer from the Blue
Jesus grown quite fat.”</p>

<p>“Eh mon Dieu!” Father Nostradamus
half-audibly sighed.</p>

<p>“Eh mon Dieu ...” Mademoiselle de
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
Nazianzi echoed, her gaze roving over the
palace, whose long window-panes in the
setting sun gleamed like sumptuous tissues.</p>

<p>“So that,” the Countess added, “I
hardly propose to venture again.”</p>

<p>“What a site for a Calvary!” Father
Nostradamus replied, indicating with a
detached and pensive air the cleft in the
White Mountain’s distant peaks.</p>

<p>“I adore the light the hills take on when
the sun drops down,” Mademoiselle de
Nazianzi declared.</p>

<p>“It must be close on <i>Salut</i>....”</p>

<p>It was beneath the dark colonnades by
the Court Chapel door that they received
the news from the lips of a pair of vivacious
dowagers that the Prince was to leave the
Summer-Palace on the morrow to attend
“the Manœuvres,” after which it was expected
his Royal Highness would proceed
“<i>to England</i>.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span></p>

<h2 id="X">X</h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">And</span> meanwhile the representatives of
the Court of St James were enjoying
the revivifying country air and
outdoor-life of the Villa Clement. It was
almost exquisite how rapidly the casual
mode of existence adopted during the
summer villeggiatura by their Excellencies,
drew themselves and their personnel together,
until soon they were as united and
as <i>sans g&ecirc;ne</i> as the proverbial family party.
No mother, in the “acclimatization” period,
could have dosed her offspring more assiduously
than did her Excellency the attach&eacute;s
in her charge; flavouring her little inventions
frequently with rum or gin until they
resembled cocktails. But it was Sir Somebody
himself if anyone that required a tonic.
Lady Something’s pending litigation, involving
as it did the crown, was fretting
the Ambassador more than he cared to
admit, and the Hon. Mrs Chilleywater, ever
alert, told “Harold” that the injudicious
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
chatter of the Ambassadress (who even
now notwithstanding her writ, would say
to every other visitor that came to the
villa: “Have you heard about the Ritz??
The other night we were dining at the
Palace, and I heard the King,” <i>etc.</i>) was
wearing their old Chief out.</p>

<p>And so through the agreeable vacation life
there twitched the grim vein of tension.</p>

<p>One day disturbed by her daughter’s
persistent trilling of the latest coster song
<i>When I sees ’im I topple giddy</i>, Lady
Something gathered up her morning letters
and stepped out upon the lawn.</p>

<p>Oh so formal, oh so slender towered the
Cypress-trees against the rose-farded hills
and diamantine waters of the lake. The
first hint of Autumn was in the air; and
over the gravel paths, and in the basins
of the fountains, a few shed leaves lay
hectically strewn already.</p>

<p>Besides an under-stamped missive, with
a foreign postmark, from her Majesty the
Queen of the Land of Dates beginning “My
dear Gazel,” there was a line from the
eloquent, and moderately-victorious, young
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
barrister, engaged in the approaching suit
with the Ritz: He had spared himself no
pains he assured his client in preparing
the defence, which was he said to be <i>the
respectability of Claridge’s</i>.</p>

<p>“Why bring in Claridge’s? ...?” the
Ambassadress murmured, prodding with the
tip of her shoe a decaying tortoiseshell leaf;
“but anyway,” she reflected, “I’m glad
the proceedings fall in winter, as I always
look well in furs.”</p>

<p>And mentally she was wrapped in leopard
skins and gazing round the crowded court
saluting with a bunch of violets an acquaintance
here and there, as her eyes
fell on Mrs Chilleywater seated in the act
of composition beneath a cedar-tree.</p>

<p>Mrs Chilleywater extended a painful smile
of welcome which revealed her pointed
teeth and pale-hued gums, repressing,
simultaneously, an almost irresistible inclination
to murder.</p>

<p>“What!... Another writ?” she
suavely asked.</p>

<p>“No, dear; but these legal men <i>will</i>
write....”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span></p>

<p>“I love your defender. He has an air of
d’Alembert sympathetic soul.”</p>

<p>“He proposes pleading Claridge’s.”</p>

<p>“Claridge’s?”</p>

<p>“Its respectability.”</p>

<p>“Are hotels ever respectable,&mdash;I ask
you. Though, possibly, the horridest are.”</p>

<p>“Aren’t they all horrid!”</p>

<p>“<i>Nat&uuml;rlich</i>; but do you know those cheap
hotels where the guests are treated like
naughty children?”</p>

<p>“No. I must confess I don’t,” the
Ambassadress laughed.</p>

<p>“Ah, there you are....”</p>

<p>Lady Something considered a moment
a distant gardener employed in tying
Chrysanthemum blooms to little sticks.</p>

<p>“I’m bothered about a cook,” she said.</p>

<p>“And I, about a maid! I dismissed
Ffoliott this morning&mdash;well I simply <i>had</i> to&mdash;for
a figure salient.”</p>

<p>“So awkward out here to replace anyone;
I’m sure I don’t know....” the
Ambassadress replied, her eyes hovering
tragically over the pantaloons strained to
<i>splitting</i> point, of the stooping gardener.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span></p>

<p>“It’s a pretty prospect....”</p>

<p>“Life is a compound!” Lady Something
defined it at last.</p>

<p>Mrs Chilleywater turned surprised.
“Not even Socrates,” she declared, “said
anything truer than that.”</p>

<p>“A compound!” Lady Something
twittered again.</p>

<p>“I should like to put that into the lips of
Delitsiosa.”</p>

<p>“Who’s Delitsiosa?” the Ambassadress
asked as a smothered laugh broke out
beside her.</p>

<p>Mrs Chilleywater looked up.</p>

<p>“I’d forgotten you were there. Strange
thing among the cedar-boughs,” she said.</p>

<p>The Hon. Lionel Limpness tossed a
slippered foot flexibly from his hammock.</p>

<p>“You may well ask ‘who’s Delitsiosa’!”
he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“She is my new heroine,” Mrs Chilleywater
replied, after a few quick little clutches
at her hair.</p>

<p>“I trust you won’t treat her, dear, quite
so shamefully as your last.”</p>

<p>The Authoress tittered.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span></p>

<p>“Delitsiosa is the wife of Marsden Didcote,”
she said, “the manager of a pawn-shop
in the district of Maida Vale, and in
the novel he seduces an innocent seamstress,
Iris Drummond, who comes in one day to
redeem her petticoat (and really I don’t
know how I did succeed in drawing the
portrait of a little fool!) ... and when
Delitsiosa, her suspicions aroused, can no
longer doubt or ignore her husband’s intimacy
with Iris, already engaged to a lusty
young farmer in Kent&mdash;(some boy)&mdash;she
decides to yield herself to the entreaties of
her brother-in-law Percy, a junior partner
in the firm, which brings about the great
tussle between the two brothers on the
edge of the Kentish cliffs. Iris and Delitsiosa&mdash;Iris
is anticipating a babelet soon&mdash;are
watching them from a cornfield, where
they’re boiling a kettle for afternoon tea;
and oh, I’ve such a darling description of a
cornfield. I make you <i>feel</i> England!”</p>

<p>“No really, my dear,” Lady Something
exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Harold pretends it would be wonderful,
arranged as an Opera ... with duos and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
things and a <i>Liebestod</i> for Delitzi towards
the close.”</p>

<p>“No, no,” Mr Limpness protested:
“What would become of our modern fiction
at all if Victoria Gellybore Frinton gave
herself up to the stage?”</p>

<p>“That’s quite true, strange thing among
the cedar-boughs,” Mrs Chilleywater returned
fingering the floating strings of the
bandelette at her brow: “It’s lamentable;
yet who is there doing anything at present for
English Letters...? Who among us to-day,”
she went on peering up at him, “is carrying
on the tradition of Fielding? Who really
cares? I know <i>I</i> do what I can ... and
there’s Madam Adrian Bloater, of course.
But I can think of no one else;&mdash;we two.”</p>

<p>Mr Limpness rocked, critically.</p>

<p>“I can’t bear Bloater’s books,” he demurred.</p>

<p>“To be frank, neither can I. I’m very
fond of Lilian Bloater, I adore her <i>welt-b&uuml;rgerliche</i>
nature, but I feel like you about
her books; I <i>cannot</i> read them. If only
she would forget Adrian; but she will
thrust him headlong into all her work.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
Have <i>I</i> ever drawn Harold? No. (Although
many of the public seem to think
so!) And please heaven, however <i>great</i> my
provocation at times may be, I never shall!”</p>

<p>“And there I think you’re right,” the
Ambassadress answered, frowning a little
as the refrain that her daughter was singing
caught her ear.</p>

<p>“There; they’ve routed Sir Somebody....”</p>

<p>“And when anything vexes him,” Lady
Something murmured, appraising the Ambassador’s
approaching form with a glassy
eye, “he always, you know, blames me!”</p>

<p>Shorn of the sombre, betailed attire, so
indispensable for the town-duties of a
functionary, Sir Somebody, while rusticating,
usually wore a white-twill jacket, and
black multi-pleated pantaloons; while for
headgear, he would favour a Mexican sugar-loaf,
or green-draped pugaree: “He looks
half-Irish,” Lady Something would sometimes
say.</p>

<p>“Infernal Bedlam,” he broke out: “the
house is sheer pandemonium.”</p>

<p>“I found it so too, dear,” Lady Something
agreed; “and so,” she added, removing
a fallen tree-bug tranquilly from
her hair, “I’ve been digesting my letters
out here upon the lawn.”</p>

<p>“And no doubt,” Sir Somebody murmured,
fixing the placid person of his wife,
with a keen psychological glance: “you
succeed, my dear, in digesting them?”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span></p>

<p>“Why shouldn’t I?”</p>

<p>“...” the Ambassador displayed
discretion.</p>

<p>“We’re asked to a Lion hunt in the Land
of Dates; quite an <i>entreating</i> invitation
from the dear Queen&mdash;; really most pressing
and affectionate, but Princess Elsie’s
nuptial negotiations and this pending
Proc&egrave;s with the Ritz, may tie us here for
some time.”</p>

<p>“Ah Rosa.”</p>

<p>“Why these constant moans? ...? A
clairvoyant once told me I’d ‘the bump of
Litigation’&mdash;a <i>cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bre</i> unmistakably
defined; so it’s as well, on the whole, to
have it over.”</p>

<p>“And quite probably; had your statement
been correct&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The Ambassadress gently glowed</p>

<p>“I’m told it’s simply swarming!” she
impenitently said.</p>

<p>“Oh Rosa, Rosa....”</p>

<p>“And if you doubt it at all, here is an
account direct from the Ritz itself,” her
Excellency replied, singling out a letter
from among the rest: “It is from dear old
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
General Sir Trotter-Stormer. He says:
‘I am the only guest here. I must say,
however, the attendance is beyond all
praise, more <i>soign&eacute;</i> and better than I’ve
ever known it to be, but after what you
told me, dear friend, I feel <i>distinctly uncomfortable</i>
when the hour for bye-bye comes!’”</p>

<p>“Pish; what evidence, pray, is that?”</p>

<p>“I regard it as of the very first importance!
Sir Trotter admits&mdash;a distinguished
soldier admits, his uneasiness; and who
knows, he is so brave about concealing his
woes&mdash;his two wives left him!&mdash;what he may
not have patiently and stoically endured?”</p>

<p>“Less I am sure, my dear, than I of late
in listening sometimes to you.”</p>

<p>“I will write I think and press him for a
more detailed report....”</p>

<p>The Ambassador turned away.</p>

<p>“She should no more be trusted with ink
than a child with firearms!” he declared,
addressing himself with studious indirectness
to a garden-snail.</p>

<p>Lady Something blinked.</p>

<p>“Life is a compound,” she murmured
again.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span></p>

<p>“Particularly for women!” the Authoress
agreed.</p>

<p>“Ah, well,” the Ambassadress majestically
rose: “I must be off and issue household
orders; although I derive hardly my
usual amount of enjoyment at present, I
regret to say, from my morning consultations
with the cook....”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span></p>

<h2 id="XI">XI</h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">It</span> had been once the whim, and was
now the felicitous habit of the Countess
of Tolga to present Count Cabinet
annually with a bouquet of flowers. It was
as if Venus-Anadyomene herself, standing<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a>
on a shell and wafted by all the piquant
whispers of the town and court, would intrude
upon the flattered exile (with her
well-wired orchids, and malicious, soulless,
laughter), to awaken delicate, pagan images,
of a trecento, Tuscan Greece.</p>

<p>But upon this occasion desirous of introducing
some new features, the Countess
decided on presenting the fallen senator
with a pannier of well-grown, early pears,
a small “heath,” and the Erotic Poems
bound in half calf with tasteful tooling of a
Schoolboy Poet, cherishable chiefly, perhaps,
for the vignette frontispiece of the
author. Moreover, acting on an impulse
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
she was never able afterwards to explain,
she had invited Mademoiselle Olga Blumenghast
to accompany her.</p>

<p>Never had summer shown a day more
propitiously clement, than the afternoon
in mid-Autumn they prepared to set out.</p>

<p>Fond of a compliment, when not too
frankly racy,<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> and knowing how susceptible
the exile was to clothes, the Countess
had arrayed herself in a winter gown of
kingfisher-tinted silk turning to turquoise,
and stencilled in purple at the arms and
neck with a crisp Greek-key design; while
a voluminous violet veil, depending behind
her to a point, half-concealed a tricorne
turquoise toque from which arose a shaded
lilac aigrette branching several ways.</p>

<p>“I shall probably die with heat, and of
course it’s most unsuitable; but poor old
man, he likes to recall the Capital!” the
Countess panted, as, nursing heath, poems
and pears, she followed Mademoiselle Olga
Blumenghast blindly towards the shore.</p>

<p>Oars, and swaying drying nets, a skyline
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
lost in sun, a few moored craft beneath the
little rickety wooden pier awaiting choice:&mdash;
“The boatmen, to-day, darling, seem all
so ugly; let’s take a sailing-boat and go
alone!”</p>

<p>“I suppose there’s no danger, darling?”
the Countess replied, and scarcely had she
time to make any slight objection, than the
owner of a steady wide-bottomed boat&mdash;the
<i>Calypso</i>&mdash;was helping them to embark.</p>

<p>The Island of St Helena, situated towards
the lake’s bourne, lay distant some two
miles or more, and within a short way of
the open sea.</p>

<p>With sails distended to a languid breeze
the shore eventually was left behind; and
the demoiselle cranes, in mid-lake, were able
to observe there were two court dames
among them.</p>

<p>“Although he’s dark, Vi,” Mademoiselle
Olga Blumenghast presently exclaimed,
dropping her cheek to a frail hand upon the
tiller, “although he’s dark, it’s odd how he
gives one the impression somehow of perfect
fairness!”</p>

<p>“Who’s that, darling?” the Countess
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
murmured, appraising with fine eyes, faintly
weary, the orchid-like style of beauty of her
friend.</p>

<p>“Ann-Jules, of course.”</p>

<p>“I begin to wish, do you know, I’d brought
Pomegranates, and worn something else!”</p>

<p>“What are those big burley-worleys?”</p>

<p>“Pears....”</p>

<p>“Give me one.”</p>

<p>“Catch, then.”</p>

<p>“Not that I could bear to be married;
especially like <i>you</i>, Vi!”</p>

<p>“A marriage like ours, dear, was so
utterly unworthwhile....”</p>

<p>“I’m not sure, dear, that I comprehend
altogether?”</p>

<p>“Seagulls’ wings as they fan one’s
face....”</p>

<p>“It’s vile and wrong to shoot them:
but oh! How I wish your happiness depended,
even ever so little, on me.”</p>

<p>The Countess averted her eyes.</p>

<p>Waterfowl, like sadness passing, hovered,
and soared overhead, casting their dark,
fleeting shadows to the white, drowned
clouds, in the receptive waters of the lake.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span></p>

<p>“I begin to wish I’d brought grapes,” she
breathed.</p>

<p>“Heavy stodgy pears. So do I.”</p>

<p>“Or a few special peaches,” the Countess
murmured, taking up the volume of verse
beside her, with a little, mirthless, half-hysterical
laugh.</p>

<p><i>To a Faithless Friend.</i></p>

<p><i>To V.O.I. and S.C.P.</i></p>

<p><i>For Stephen.</i></p>

<p><i>When the Dormitory Lamp burns Low.</i></p>

<p>Her gaze travelled over the Index.</p>

<p>“Read something, dear,” Mademoiselle
Blumenghast begged, toying with the red-shaded
flower in her burnished curls.</p>

<p>“Gladly; but oh, Olga!” the Countess
crooned.</p>

<p>“What!”</p>

<p>“Where’s the wind?”</p>

<p>It had gone.</p>

<p>“We must row.”</p>

<p>There was nothing for it.</p>

<p>To gain the long, white breakwater, with
the immemorial willow-tree at its end, that
was the most salient feature of the island’s
approach, required, nevertheless, resolution.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span></p>

<p>“It’s so far, dear,” the Countess kept on
saying. “I had no idea how far it was!
Had you any conception at all it was so
far?”</p>

<p>“Let us await the wind, then. It’s
bound to rally.”</p>

<p>But no air swelled the sun-bleached
sails, or disturbed the pearly patine of the
paralysed waters.</p>

<p>“I shall never get this peace, I only
realise it <i>exists</i> ...” the Countess murmured
with dream-glazed eyes.</p>

<p>“It’s astonishing ... the stillness,”
Mademoiselle Blumenghast murmured, with
a faint tremor, peering round towards the
shore.</p>

<p>On the banks young censia-trees raised
their boughs like strong white whips towards
the mountains, upon whose loftier heights
lay, here and there, a little stray patch of
snow.</p>

<p>“Come hither, ye winds, come hither!”
she softly called.</p>

<p>“Oh, Olga! Do we really want it?”
the Countess in agitation asked, discarding
her hat and veil with a long, sighing breath.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span></p>

<p>“I don’t know, dear; no; not, not
much.”</p>

<p>“Nor I,&mdash;at all.”</p>

<p>“Let us be patient then.”</p>

<p>“It’s all so beautiful it makes one want
to cry.”</p>

<p>“Yes; it makes one want to cry,”
Mademoiselle Blumenghast murmured, with
a laugh that in brilliance vied with the
October sun.</p>

<p>“Olga!”</p>

<p>“So,” as the <i>Calypso</i> lurched: “lend
me your hanky, dearest.”</p>

<p>“<i>Olga</i>&mdash;? &mdash;? Thou fragile, and exquisite
thing!”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Meanwhile Count Cabinet was seated
with rod-and-line at an open window, idly
ogling a swan. Owing to the reluctance of
tradespeople to call for orders, the banished
statesman was often obliged to supplement
the larder himself. But hardly had he
been angling ten minutes to-day, when lo!
a distinguished mauvish fish with vivid
scarlet spots. Pondering on the mysteries
of the deep, and of the subtle variety there
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
is in Nature, the veteran ex-minister lit a
cigar. Among the more orthodox types
that stocked the lake, such as carp, cod,
tench, eels, sprats, shrimps, etc., this exceptional
fish must have known its trials
and persecutions, its hours of superior
difficulty ... and the Count, with a stoic
smile recalled his own. Musing on the
advantages and disadvantages of personality,
of “party” viewpoints, and of
morals in general, the Count was soon too
self-absorbed to observe the approach of
his “useful” secretary and amanuensis,
Peter Passer.</p>

<p>More valet perhaps than secretary, and
more errand-boy than either, the former
chorister of the Blue Jesus had followed
the fallen statesman into exile at a moment
when the Authorities of Pisuerga were
making minute enquiries for sundry
missing articles,<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> from the <i>Tr&eacute;sor</i> of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
Cathedral, and since the strain of constant
choir-practice is apt to be injurious for a
youngster suffering from a delicate chest,
the adolescent had been willing enough to
accept, for a time, at least, a situation in
the country.</p>

<p>“O, sir,” he exclaimed, and almost in
his excitement forgetting altogether the
insidious, lisping tones he preferred as a
rule to employ: “O, sir, here comes that
old piece of rubbish again with a fresh pack
of tracts!”</p>

<p>“Collect yourself, Peter, pray do: what,
lose our heads for a visit?” the Count
said getting up and going to a glass.</p>

<p>“I’ve noticed, sir, it’s impossible to live
on an island long without feeling its effects;
you <i>can’t</i> escape being insular!”</p>

<p>“Or insolent.”</p>

<p>“Insular, sir!”</p>

<p>“No matter much, but if it’s the Countess
Yvorra, you might shew her round the
garden this time, perhaps, for a change,”
the Count replied, adjusting a demure-looking
fly, of indeterminate sex, to his
line.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span></p>

<p>And brooding on life and baits, and what
<i>A</i> will come for while <i>B</i> won’t, the Count’s
thoughts grew almost humorous as the
afternoon wore on.</p>

<p>Evening was approaching, when weary
of the airs of a common carp, he drew in,
at length, his tackle.</p>

<p>Like a shawl of turquoise silk the lake
seemed to vie, in serenity and radiance,
with the bluest day in June, and it was
no surprise, on descending presently for
a restricted ramble&mdash;(the island, in all,
amounted to scarcely one acre)&mdash;to descry
the invaluable Peter enjoying a pleasant
swim.</p>

<p>When not boating or reading or feeding
his swans, to watch Peter’s fancy-diving
off the terrace end, was perhaps the
favourite pastime of the veteran <i>viveur</i>:
to behold the lad trip along the riven
breakwater, as naked as a statue, shoot out
his arms and spring, the <i>Flying-head-leap</i>
or the <i>Backsadilla</i>, was a beautiful sight,
looking up now and again&mdash;but more often
<i>now</i>&mdash;from a volume of old Greek verse;
while to hear him warbling in the water
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
with his clear alto voice&mdash;of Kyries and
Anthems he knew no end&mdash;would often stir
the old man to the point of tears. Frequently
the swans themselves would paddle
up to listen, expressing by the charmed or
rapturous motions of their necks (recalling
to the exile the ecstasies of certain musical,
or “artistic” dames at Concert-halls, or
the Opera House, long ago) their mute
appreciation, their touched delight....</p>

<p>“Old goody Two-shoes never came, sir,”
Peter archly lisped, admiring his adventurous
shadow upon the breakwater wall.</p>

<p>“How is that?”</p>

<p>“Becalmed, sir,” Peter answered, culling
languidly a small, nodding rose, that was
clinging to the wall:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“O becalmed is my soul<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I rejoice in the Lord!”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>At one extremity of the garden stood the
Observatory, and after duly appraising
various of Peter’s neatest feats, the Count
strolled away towards it. But before he
could reach the Observatory, he had first
to pass his swans.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span></p>

<p>They lived, with an ancient water-wheel,
beneath a cupola of sun-glazed tiles,
sheltered, partially, from the lake by a
hedge of towering red geraniums, and the
Count seldom wearied of watching these
strangely gorgeous creatures as they sailed
out and in through the sanguine-hued
flowers. A few, with their heads sunk back
beneath their wings, had retired for the
night already; nevertheless, the Count
paused to shake a finger at one somnolent
bird, in disfavour for pecking Peter:
“Jealous, doubtless of the lad’s grace,”
he mused, fumbling with the key of the
Observatory door.</p>

<p>The unrivalled instrument that the
Observatory contained, whose intricate
lenses were capable of drawing even the
remote Summer-Palace to within an appreciable
range, was, like most instruments of
merit, sensitive to the manner of its manipulation;
and fearing lest the inexpert
tampering of a homesick housekeeper
(her native village was visible in clear
weather, with the aid of a glass) should
break or injure the delicate lenses, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
Count kept the Observatory usually under
key.</p>

<p>But the inclination to focus the mundane
and embittered features of the fanatic
Countess, as she lectured her boatmen for
forgetting their oars, or, being considerably
superstitious, to count the moles on their
united faces as an esoteric clue to the
Autumn Lottery, waned a little before the
mystery of the descending night.</p>

<p>Beneath a changing tide of deepening
shadow, the lifeless valleys were mirroring
to the lake the sombreness of dusk. Across
the blue forlornness of the water, a swan,
here and there, appeared quite violet,
while coiffed in swift clinging, golden
clouds, the loftiest hills alone retained
the sun.</p>

<p>A faint nocturnal breeze, arising simultaneously
with the Angelus-bell, seemed
likely to relieve, at the moon’s advent, the
trials to her patience of the Countess
Yvorra: “who must be cursing,” the
Count reflected, turning the telescope
about with a sigh, to suit her sail.</p>

<p>Ah poignant moments when the heart
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
stops still! Not since the hour of his exile
had the Count’s been so arrested.</p>

<p>From the garden Peter’s voice rose
questingly; but the Count was too wonder-struck,
far, to heed it.</p>

<p>Caught in the scarlet radiance of the
afterglow, the becalmed boat, for one brief
and most memorable second, was his to
gaze on.</p>

<p>In certain lands with what diplomacy
falls the night, and how discreetly is the
daylight gone: Those dimmer-and-dimmer,
darker-and-lighter twilights of the North,
so disconcerting in their playfulness, were
unknown altogether in Pisuerga. There,
Night pursued Day, as though she meant
it. No lingering, or arctic sentiment! No
concertinaishness.... Hard on the sun’s
heels, pressed Night. And the wherefore of
her haste; Sun-attraction? Impatience to
inherit? An answer to such riddles as these
may doubtless be found by turning to the
scientists’ theories on Time and Relativity.</p>

<p>Effaced in the blue air of evening became
everything, and with the darkness returned
the wind.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span></p>

<p>“Sir, sir?... Ho, Hi, hiiiiiiiiiiii!!”
Peter’s voice came again.</p>

<p>But transfixed, and loath just then for
company, the Count made no reply.</p>

<p>A green-lanterned barge passed slowly,
coming from the sea, and on the mountain-side
a village light winked wanly here and
there.</p>

<p>“Oh, why was I not <i>sooner</i>?” he
murmured distractedly aloud.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“Oh Olga!”</p>

<p>“Oh Vi!”</p>

<p>“... I hope you’ve enough money
for the boat, dear? ...?”</p>

<p>“...!!?”</p>

<p>“Tell me, Olga: Is my hat all sideways?”</p>

<p>“................”</p>

<p>The long windows of the Summer-Palace
were staring white to the moon, as the
Countess of Tolga, her aigrettes casting
<i>heroic</i> shadows and hugging still her heath,
re-entered the Court’s precincts on the arm
of her friend.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span></p>

<h2 id="XII">XII</h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">One</span> evening, as Mrs Montgomery
was reading <i>Vanity Fair</i> for the
fifteenth time, there came a tap at
the door. It was not the first interruption
since opening the cherished green-bound
book, and Mrs Montgomery seemed disinclined
to stir. With the Court about to
return to winter quarters, and the Summer-Palace
upside down, the royal governess
was still able to command her habitual
British phlegm. It had been decided,
moreover, that she should remain behind
in the forsaken palace with the little
prince, the better to “prepare” him for
his forthcoming Eton exam.</p>

<p>Still, with disputes as to the precedence
of trunks and dress-baskets simmering in
the corridors without, it was easier to enjoy
the Barley-sugar stick in one’s mouth,
than the Novel in one’s hand.</p>

<p>“Thank God I’m not touchy!” Mrs
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
Montgomery reflected, rolling her eyes
lazily about the little white wainscoted
room.</p>

<p>It was as if something of her native land
had crept in through the doorway with
her, so successfully had she inculcated its
tendencies, or spiritual Ideals, upon everything
around.</p>

<p>A solitary teapot, on a bracket, above
the door, two <i>Jubilee</i> plates, some peacocks’
feathers, an image of a little Fisher-boy in
bathing-drawers and a broken hand;&mdash;“a
work of delicate beauty!” A mezzotint:
<i>The Coiffing of Maria</i>&mdash;these were some of
the treasures which the room contained.</p>

<p>“A blessing to be sure when the Court
has gone!” she reflected half-rising to drop
a curtsy to Prince Olaf who had entered.</p>

<p>“Word from your country,” sententiously
he broke out: “My brother’s betrothed!
So need I go on with my preparation?”</p>

<p>“Put your tie straight! And just look
at your socks all tumbling down. Such
great jambons of knees!... What will
become of you, I ask myself, when you’re a
lower boy at Eton.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span></p>

<p>“How can I be a lower boy when I’m a
Prince?”</p>

<p>“Probably, the Rev. Ruggles-White,
when you enter his House, will be able to
explain.”</p>

<p>“I won’t be a lower boy! I will <i>not</i>!”</p>

<p>“Cs, Cs.”</p>

<p>“Damn the democracy.”</p>

<p>“Fie, sir.”</p>

<p>“Down with it.”</p>

<p>“For shame.”</p>

<p>“Revenge.”</p>

<p>“That will do: and now, let me hear your
lessons: I should like,” Mrs Montgomery
murmured, her eyes set in detachment
upon the floor; “the present-indicative
tense of the Verb <i>To be</i>! Adding the
words, Political h-Hostess;&mdash;more for the
sake of the pronunciation than for anything
else.”</p>

<p>And after considerable persuasion, prompting,
and “bribing,” with various sorts of
sweets:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“I am a Political Hostess,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Thou art a Political Hostess,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
<span class="i1">He is a Political Hostess,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">We are Political Hostesses,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Ye are Political Hostesses,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">They are Political Hostesses.”<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>“Very good, dear, and only one mistake.
<i>He</i> is a Political h-Hostess: Can
you correct yourself? The error is so
slight....”</p>

<p>But alas the prince was in no mood for
study; and Mrs Montgomery very soon
afterwards was obliged to let him go.</p>

<p>Moving a little anxiously about the
room, her meditations turned upon the
future.</p>

<p>With the advent of Elsie a new r&eacute;gime
would be established: increasing Britishers
would wish to visit Pisuerga; and it
seemed a propitious moment to abandon
teaching, and to inaugurate in Kairoulla an
English hotel.</p>

<p>“I have no more rooms. I am quite
full up!” she smiled, addressing the silver
andirons in the grate.</p>

<p>And what a deliverance to have done
with instructing unruly children, she
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
reflected, going towards the glass mail-box
attached to her vestibule door. Sometimes
about this hour there would be a
letter in it, but this evening there was only
a picture postcard of a field mouse in a
bonnet, from her old friend Mrs Bedley.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“We have <i>Valmouth</i> at last,” she read,
“and was it you, my dear, who asked for
<i>The Beard Throughout the Ages</i>? It is in
much demand, but I am keeping it back
anticipating a <i>reply</i>. Several of the plates
are missing I see, among them, those of
the late King Edward, and of Assur Bani
Pal; I only mention it, that, you may
know I shan’t blame you! We are having
wonderful weather, and I am keeping
pretty well, although poor Mrs Barleymoon,
I fear, will not see through another winter.

</p>

<p>“P.S.&mdash;<i>Man, and All About Him</i>, is
rebinding. Ready I expect soon.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“Ah! Cunnie, Cunnie ...?” Mrs
Montgomery murmured, laying the card
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
down near a photograph of the Court-physician
with a sigh: “Ah! Arthur Amos
Cuncliffe Babcock ...?” she invoked
his name dulcetly in full: and as though
in telepathic response, there came a tap at
the door, and the doctor himself looked in.</p>

<p>He had been attending, it seemed, the
young wife of the Comptroller of the Household
at the extremity of the corridor; a
creature, who, after two brief weeks of
marriage, imagined herself to be in an
interesting state: “<i>I believe baby’s coming!</i>”
she would cry out every few hours.</p>

<p>“Do I intrude?” he demanded, in his
forceful, virile voice, that ladies knew and
liked: “pray say so if I do.”</p>

<p>“Does he intrude!” Mrs Montgomery
flashed an arch glance towards the cornice.</p>

<p>“Well, and how are you keeping?” the
doctor asked, dropping on to a rep causeuse
that stood before the fire.</p>

<p>“I’m only semi-well, doctor, thanks!”</p>

<p>“Why, what’s the trouble?”</p>

<p>“You know my organism is not a very
strong one, Dr Cuncliffe ...” Mrs Montgomery
replied, drawing up a chair, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
settling a cushion with a sigh of resignation
at her back.</p>

<p>“Imagination!”</p>

<p>“If only it were!”</p>

<p>“Imagination,” he repeated, fixing a
steady eye on the short train of her black
brocaded robe that all but brushed his feet.</p>

<p>“If that’s your explanation for continuous
broken sleep ...” she gently
snapped.</p>

<p>“Try mescal.”</p>

<p>“I’m trying Dr Fritz Millar’s treatment,”
the lady stated, desiring to deal a slight
<i>scratch</i> to his masculine <i>amour propre</i>.</p>

<p>“Millar’s an Ass.”</p>

<p>“I don’t agree at all!” she incisively
returned, smiling covertly at his touch of
pique.</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>“Oh it’s horrid. You first of all lie
down; and then you drink cold water in
the sun.”</p>

<p>“Cold what? I never <i>heard</i> of such a
thing: It’s enough to kill you.”</p>

<p>Mrs Montgomery took a deep-drawn
breath of languor.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span></p>

<p>“And would you care, doctor, so <i>very</i>
much if it did?” she asked, as a page
made his appearance with an ice-bucket
and champagne.</p>

<p>“To toast our young Princess!”</p>

<p>“Oh, oh, Dr Cuncliffe? What a wicked
man you are:” And for a solemn moment
their thoughts went out in unison to the
sea-girt land of their birth&mdash;Barkers’,
Selfridges’, Brighton-pier, the Zoological
gardens on a Sunday afternoon.</p>

<p>“Here’s to the good old country!” the
doctor quaffed.</p>

<p>“The Bride, and,” Mrs Montgomery
raised her glass, “the Old Folks at h-home.”</p>

<p>“The Old Folks at home!” he vaguely
echoed.</p>

<p>“Bollinger, you naughty man,” the lady
murmured, amiably seating herself on the
causeuse at his side.</p>

<p>“You’ll find it dull here all alone after
the Court has gone,” he observed, smiling
down, a little despotically, on to her bright,
abundant hair.</p>

<p>Mrs Montgomery sipped her wine.</p>

<p>“When the wind goes whistling up and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
down under the colonnades: oh, then!”
she shivered.</p>

<p>“You’ll wish for a fine, bold Pisuergian
husband; shan’t you?” he answered, his
foot drawing closer to hers.</p>

<p>“Often of an evening, I feel I need
fostering,” she owned, glancing up yearningly
into his face.</p>

<p>“Fostering, eh?” he chuckled, refilling
with exuberance her glass.</p>

<p>“Why is it that wine always makes me
feel <i>so good</i>?”</p>

<p>“Probably, because it fills you with
affection for your neighbour!”</p>

<p>“It’s true; I feel I could be very affectionate:
I’m what they call an ‘amoureuse’
I suppose, and there it is....”</p>

<p>There fell a busy silence between them.</p>

<p>“It’s almost too warm for a fire,” she
murmured, repairing towards the window;
“but I like to hear the crackle!”</p>

<p>“Company, eh?” he returned, following
her (a trifle unsteadily) across the room.</p>

<p>“The night is so clear the moon looks to
be almost transparent,” she languorously
observed, with a long tugging sigh.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span></p>

<p>“And so it does,” he absently agreed.</p>

<p>“I adore the Pigeons in my wee court
towards night, when they sink down like
living sapphires upon the stones,” she
sentimentally said, sighing languorously
again.</p>

<p>“Ours,” he assured her; “since the
surgery looks on to it, too....”</p>

<p>“Did you ever see anything so ducky-wucky,
so completely twee!” she inconsequently
chirruped.</p>

<p>“Allow me to fill this empty glass.”</p>

<p>“I want to go out on all that gold
floating water!” she murmured listlessly,
pointing towards the lake.</p>

<p>“Alone?”</p>

<p>“Drive me towards the sweet seaside,”
she begged, taking appealingly his hand.</p>

<p>“Aggie?”</p>

<p>“Arthur&mdash;Arthur, for God’s sake!” she
shrilled, as with something between a snarl
and a roar, he impulsively whipped out
the light.</p>

<p>“H-Help! Oh Arth&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Thus did they celebrate the “Royal
engagement.”

tissue, her many Orders of Merit almost
bearing her down.’”</p>

<p>“Thy scissors, O Sidi, for the love of
Muhammed?”</p>

<p>“‘It seemed as if Kairoulla had gone
wild with joy. Led by the first Life-Guards
and a corps of ladies of great fashion disguised
as peasants, the cort&egrave;ge proceeded
amid the whole-hearted plaudits of the
people towards Constitutional Square,
where, with the sweetest of smiles and
thanks the princess received an exquisite
sheaf of Deflas (they are the hybrids of
slipper-orchids crossed with maidens-rue, and
are all the mode at present), tendered her
by little Paula Exelmans, the Lord Mayor’s
tiny daughter. Driving on, amid showers
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
of confetti, the procession passed up the
Chaus&eacute;e, which presented a scene of rare
animation; boys, and even quite elderly
dames swarming up the trees to obtain a
better view of their new Princess. But it
was not until Lilianthal Street and the
Cathedral Square were reached, that the
climax reached its height! Here, a short
standstill was called, and after an appropriate
address from the Archbishop of
Pisuerga, the stirring strains of the National
Anthem, superbly rendered by Madame
Marguerite Astorra of the State Theatre
(she is in perfect voice this season), arose
on the air. At that moment a black cat
and its kitties rushed across the road, and
I saw the Princess smile.’”</p>

<p>“Thy scissors, O Sidi, in the Name of
the Prophet!”</p>

<p>“‘A touching incident,’” Sidi with
equanimity pursued, “‘was just before the
English Tea Rooms, where the English
Colony had mustered together in force....’”</p>

<p>But alack for those interested. Owing
to the clamour about him much of the
recital was lost: “‘Cheers and tears....
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
... Life’s benison.... Honiton lace....
If I live to be <i>forty</i>, it was a moment I shall
never forget.... Panic ... congestion....
Police.’”</p>

<p>But it was scarcely needful to peruse
the paper, when on the boulevards outside,
the festivities were everywhere in full
swing. The arrival of the princess for her
wedding had brought to Kairoulla unprecedented
crowds from all parts of the
kingdom, as much eager to see the princess,
as to catch a glimpse of the fine pack of
beagles, that it was said had been brought
over with her, and which had taken an
half eerie hold of the public mind.
Gilderoy, Beausire, Audrey, many of the
dogs’ names were known pleasantly to the
crowd already; and anecdotes of Audrey,
picture-postcards of Audrey, were sold as
rapidly almost as those even of the princess.
Indeed mothers among the people had
begun to threaten their disobedient offspring
with Audrey, whose silky, thickset
frame was supported, it appeared, daily on
troublesome little boys and tiresome little
girls....
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span></p>

<p>“Erri, erri, get on with thy bouquet, oh
Lazari Demitraki!” Bachir exclaimed in
plaintive tones, addressing a blonde boy
with a skin of amber, who was “charming”
an earwig with a reed of grass.</p>

<p>“She dance the <i>Boussadilla</i> just like in
the street of Halfaouine in Garda&iuml;a my
town any Ouled Nail!” he rapturously
gurgled.</p>

<p>“Get on with thy work, oh Lazari
Demitraki,” Bachir besought him, “and
leave the earwigs alone for the clients to
find.”</p>

<p>“What with the heat, the smell of the
flowers, the noise of you boys, and with
filthy earwigs Boussadillaing all over one, I
feel I could <i>swoon</i>,” the voice, cracked yet
cloying, was Peter Passer’s.</p>

<p>He had come to Kairoulla for the
“celebrations,” and also, perhaps, aspiring
to advance his fortunes, in ways known best
to himself. With Bachir, his connection
dated from long ago, when as a Cathedral
choir-boy it had been his habit to pin a
shoulder, or bosom-blossom to his surplice,
destroying it with coquettish, ring-laden
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
fingers in the course of an anthem, and
scattering the petals from the choir-loft,
leaf by leaf, on to the grey heads of the
monsignori below.</p>

<p>“Itchiata wa?” Bachir grumbled,
playing his eyes distractedly around the
shop. And it might have been better for
the numerous orders there were to attend
to had he called fewer of his acquaintance
to assist him. Sunk in torpor, a cigarette
smouldering at his ear, a Levantine Greek
known as “Effendi darling” was listening
to a dark-cheeked Tunisian engaged at the
Count of Tolga’s private Hammam Baths&mdash;a
young man, who, as he spoke, would
make mazy gestures of the hands as though
his master’s ribs, or those of some illustrious
guest, lay under him. But by no means
all of those assembled in the little shop,
bore the seal of Islam. An American who
had grown too splendid for the copper
“Ganymede” or Soda-fountain of a Caf&eacute;
bar and had taken to teaching the hectic
dance-steps of his native land in the night-halls
where Bachir sold, was achieving
wonders with some wires and Eucharist
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
lilies, while discussing with a shy-mannered
youth the many difficulties that beset the
foreigner in Kairoulla.</p>

<p>“Young chaps that come out here,
don’t know what they’re coming to,” he
sapiently remarked, using his incomparable
teeth in place of scissors. “Gosh! Talk
of advancement,” he growled.</p>

<p>“There’s few can mix as I can, yet I
don’t never get no rise!” the shy youth
exclaimed, producing a card that was
engraved: <i>Harry Cummings, Salad-Dresser
to the King</i>: “I expect I’ve arrived,” he
murmured, turning to hide a modest blush
towards a pale young man who looked on
life through heavy horn glasses.</p>

<p>“Salad dressing? I’d sooner it was hair!
You do get tips there anyway,” the Yankee
reasoned.</p>

<p>“I wish <i>I</i> were&mdash;arrived,” the young
man with the glasses, by name Guy Thin,
declared. He had come out but recently
from England to establish a “British
Grocery,” and was the owner of what is
sometimes called an expensive voice, his
sedulously clear articulation missing out
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
no syllable or letter of anything he might
happen to be saying, as though he were
tasting each word, like the Pure tea, or the
Pure marmalade, or any other of the so
very Pure goods he proposed so exclusively
to sell.</p>

<p>“If Allah wish it then you arrive,”
Lazari Demitraki assured him with a
dazzling smile, catching his hand in order
to construe the lines.</p>

<p>“Finish thy bouquet, O Lazari Demitraki,”
Bachir faintly moaned.</p>

<p>“It finished&mdash;arranged: it with Abou!”
he announced, pointing to an aged negro
with haunted sin-sick eyes who appeared
to be making strange grimaces at the wall.
A straw hat of splendid dimensions was on
his head, flaunting bravely the insignia of
the Firm.</p>

<p>But the old man seemed resolved to run
no more errands:</p>

<p>“Nsa, nsa,” he mumbled: “Me walk
enough for one day! Me no go out any
more. Old Abou too tired to take another
single step! As soon would me cross the
street again dis night as the Sahara!...”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span></p>

<p>And it was only after the promise of a
small gift of Opium that he consented to
leave a d&eacute;butante’s bouquet at the Th&eacute;&acirc;tre
Diana.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a></p>

<p>“In future,” Bachir rose remarking,
“I only employ the women; I keep only
girls,” he repeated, for the benefit of
“Effendi darling” who appeared to be
attaining Nirv&acirc;na.</p>

<p>“And next I suppose you keep a
Harem?” “Effendi darling” somnolently
returned.</p>

<p>Most of the city shops had closed their
shutters for the day, when Bachir shouldering
a pannier bright with blooms, stepped
with his companions forth into the street.</p>

<p>Along the Boulevards thousands were
pressing towards the Regina Gardens to
view the Fireworks, all agog to witness the
pack of beagles wrought in brilliant lights
due to course a stag across the sky, and
which would change, if newspaper reports
might be believed, at the critical moment,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
into “‘something of the nature of a
surprise.’”</p>

<p>Pausing before a plate-glass window that
adjoined the shop to adjust the flowing
folds of his gandourah, and to hoist his
flower tray to his small scornful head,
Bachir allowed his auxiliaries to drift,
mostly two by two, away among the
crowd. Only the royal salad-dresser, Harry
Cummings, expressed a demure inclination
(when the pushing young grocer caressed
his arm), to “be alone”; but Guy Thin,
who had private designs upon him, was
loath to hear of it! He wished to persuade
him to buy a bottle of Vinegar from his
Store, when he would print on his paper-bags
<i>As supplied to his Majesty the King</i>.</p>

<p>“Grant us, O Allah, each good Fortunes,”
Bachir beseeched, looking up through his
eyelashes towards the moon, that drooped
like a silver amulet in the firmament above:
in the blue nocturnal air he looked like a
purple poppy. “A toute &agrave; l’heure mes
amis!” he murmured as he moved away.</p>

<p>And in the little closed shop behind the
heavy moucharabi, now that they all had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
gone, the exhalations of the <i>flowers</i> arose;
pungent, concerted odours, expressive of
natural antipathies and feuds, suave
alliances, suffering, pride, and joy....
Only the shining moon through the
moucharabi, illumining here a lily, there
a leaf, may have guessed what they were
saying:</p>

<p>“My wires are hurting me: my wires
are hurting me.”</p>

<p>“I have no water. I cannot reach the
water.”</p>

<p>“They have pushed me head down into
the bottom of the bowl.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad I’m in a Basket! No one
will hurl <i>me</i> from a window to be bruised
under foot by the callous crowd.”</p>

<p>“It’s uncomfy, isn’t it, without one’s
roots?”</p>

<p>“You Weed you! You, you, you ...
<i>buttercup</i>! How dare you to <i>an Orchid</i>!”</p>

<p>“I shouldn’t object to sharing the same
water with him, dear.... Ordinary as he
is! If <i>only</i> he wouldn’t smell....”</p>

<p>“She’s nothing but a piece of common
grass and so I tell her!”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span></p>

<p>When upon the tense pent atmosphere
surged a breath of cooler air, and through the
street-door slipped the Duchess of Varna.</p>

<p>Overturning a jar of great heavy-headed
Gladioli with a crash, she sailed, with a
purposeful step, towards the till.</p>

<p>Garbed in black and sleepy citrons, she
seemed, indeed, to be equipped for a long,
long Voyage, and was clutching, in her arms,
a pet Poodle dog, and a levant-covered
case, in which, doubtless, reposed her jewels.</p>

<p>Since her rupture with Madame Wetme
(both the King and Queen had refused to
receive her), the money <i>ennuis</i> of the
Duchess had become increasingly acute.
Tormented by tradespeople, dunned and
bullied by creditors, menaced, mortified,
insulted&mdash;an offer to “star” in the <i>r&ocirc;le</i> of
<i>A Society Thief</i> for the cinematograph had
particularly shocked her&mdash;the inevitable
hour to quit the Court so long foreseen
had come. And now with her departure
definitely determined upon, the Duchess
experienced an insouciance of heart unknown
to her assuredly for many a year.
Replenishing her reticule with quite a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
welcome sheaf of the elegant little banknotes
of Pisuerga, one thing only remained
to do, and taking pen and paper, she
addressed to the Editor of the <i>Intelligence</i>
the supreme announcement:&mdash;“<i>The
Duchess of Varna has left for Dateland</i>.”</p>

<p>Eight light words! But enough to set
<i>tout</i> Kairoulla in a rustle.</p>

<p>“I only so regret I didn’t go sooner,”
she murmured to herself aloud, breaking
herself a rose to match her gown from an
arrangement in the window.</p>

<p>Many of the flowers had been newly
christened, “Elsie,” “Audrey,” “London-Madonnas”
(black Arums these), while
the Roses from the “Land of Punt” had
been renamed “Mrs Lloyd George”&mdash;and
priced accordingly. A basket of Odontoglossums
eked out with Gypsophila seemed
to anticipate the end, when supplies from
Punt must necessarily cease. However,
bright boys, like Bachir, seldom lacked
patrons, and the duchess recalled glimpsing
him one evening from her private sitting-room
at the Ritz Hotel, seated on a garden
bench in the Regina Gardens beside the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
Prime Minister himself; both, to all seeming,
on the most cordial terms, and to have
reached a perfect understanding as regards
the Eastern Question. Ah, the Eastern
Question! It was said that, in the Land of
Dates, one might study it well. In Djezira,
the chief town, beneath the great golden
sun, people, they said, might grow wise.
In the simoon that scatters the silver sand,
in the words of the nomads, in the fairy
mornings beneath the palms, society with
its foolish <i>clich&eacute;</i> ... the duchess smiled.</p>

<p>“But for that poisonous woman, I should
have, gone last year,” she told herself,
interrupted in her cogitations by the
appearance of her maid.</p>

<p>“The train your Grace we shall miss
it....”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” the duchess answered
following, leaving the flowers alone again
to their subtle exhalations.</p>

<p>“I’m glad <i>I’m</i> in a Basket!”</p>

<p>“I have no water. I cannot reach the
water.”</p>

<p>“Life’s bound to be uncertain when you
haven’t got your roots!”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span></p>

<h2 id="XIV">XIV</h2>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">On</span> a long-chair with tired, closed
eyes lay the Queen. Although
spared from henceforth the anxiety
of her son’s morganatic marriage, yet, now
that his destiny was sealed, she could not
help feeling perhaps he might have done
better. The bride’s lineage was nothing
to boast of&mdash;over her great-great-grandparents,
indeed, in the year 17&mdash;it were
gentler to draw a veil&mdash;while, for the rest,
disingenuous, undistinguished, more at
home in the stables than in a drawing-room,
the Queen much feared that she and
her future daughter-in-law would scarcely
get on.</p>

<p>Yes, the little princess was none too
engaging, she reflected, and her poor
sacrificed child if not actually trapped....</p>

<p>The silken swish of a fan, breaking the
silence, induced the Queen to look up.</p>

<p>In waiting at present was the Countess
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
Olivia d’Omptyda, a person of both excellent
principles and birth, if lacking, somewhat,
in social boldness. Whenever she
entered the royal presence she would begin
visibly to tremble, which considerably
flattered the Queen. Her Father, Count
“Freddie” d’Omptyda, an infantile and
charming old man, appointed in a moment
of unusual vagary Pisuergan Ambassador to
the Court of St James’, had lately married
a child wife scarcely turned thirteen, whose
frivolity, and numerous pranks on the high
dames of London, were already the scandal
of the <i>Corps Diplomatique</i>.</p>

<p>“Sssh! Noise is the last vulgarity,”
the Queen commented, raising a cushion
embroidered with raging lions and white
uncanny unicorns higher behind her head.</p>

<p>Unstrung from the numerous <i>f&ecirc;tes</i>, she
had retired to a distant boudoir to relax,
and, having partly disrobed, was feeling
remotely Venus of Miloey with her arms
half-hidden in a plain white cape.</p>

<p>The Countess d’Omptyda furled her fan.</p>

<p>“In this Age of push and shriek ...” she
said and sighed.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span></p>

<p>“It seems that neither King Geo, nor
Queen Glory, <i>ever</i> lie down of a day!” her
Dreaminess declared.</p>

<p>“Since his last appointment, neither
does Papa.”</p>

<p>“The affair of your step-mother and
Lady Diana Duff Semour,” the Queen
remarked, “appears to be assuming the
proportions of an Incident!”</p>

<p>The Countess dismally smiled. The
subject of her step-mother, mistaken frequently
for her grand-daughter, was a
painful one: “I hear she’s like a colt broke
loose!” she murmured, dropping her eyes
fearfully to her costume.</p>

<p>She was wearing an apron of Parma-violets,
and the Order of the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p>“It’s a little a pity she can’t be more sensible,”
the Queen returned, fingering listlessly
some papers at her side. Among them
was the <i>Arch&aelig;ological Society’s</i> initial report
relating to the recent finds among the Ruins
of Sodom and Gomorrah. From Chedorlahomor
came the good news that an <i>amphora</i>
had been found, from which it seemed that
men, in those days, rode sideways, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
women straddle-legs, with their heads to the
horses’ tails, while a dainty cup, ravished from
a rock-tomb in the Vale of Akko, ornamented
with naked boys and goblets of flowers,
encouraged a yet more extensive research.</p>

<p>“You may advance, Countess, with the
Arch&aelig;ologists’ report,” the Queen commanded.
“Omitting (skipping, I say) the
death of the son of Lord Intriguer.”<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a></p>

<p>“‘It was in the Vale of Akko, about two
miles from S&acirc;&acirc;da,” the Countess tremblingly
began, “that we laid bare a superb tear-bottle,
a unique specimen in <i>grisaille</i>,
severely adorned with a matron’s head.
From the inscription, there can be no doubt
whatever that we have here an authentic
portrait of Lot’s disobedient, though unfortunate
wife. Ample and statuesque (as
the salten image she was afterwards to
become), the shawl-draped, masklike features
are by no means beautiful. It is a
face that you may often see to-day, in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
down-town ‘Dancings,’ or in the bars of the
dockyards, or wharfs, of our own modern
cities, Tilbury, ’Frisco, Vera Cruz&mdash;a sodden,
gin-soaked face, that helps to vindicate, if
not, perhaps, excuse, the conduct of Lot....
With this highly interesting example of the
Potters’ Art, was found a novel object, of an
unknown nature, likely to arouse, in scientific
circles, considerable controversy....”</p>

<p>And just as the lectrice was growing
hesitant, and embarrassed, the Countess of
Tolga, who had the <i>entr&eacute;e</i>, unobtrusively
entered the room.</p>

<p>She was looking particularly well in one
of the new standing-out skirts ruched with
rosebuds, and was showing more of her
stockings than she usually did.</p>

<p>“You bring the sun with you!” the
Queen graciously exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Indeed,” the Countess answered, “I
ought to apologise for the interruption, but
the <i>poor little thing</i> is leaving now.”</p>

<p>“What? has the Abbess come?”</p>

<p>“She has sent Sister Irene of the
Incarnation, instead....”</p>

<p>“I had forgotten it was to-day.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span></p>

<p>With an innate aversion for all farewells,
yet the Queen was accustomed to perform a
score of irksome acts daily that she cordially
disliked, and when, shortly afterwards,
Mademoiselle de Nazianzi accompanied
by a Sister from the Flaming-Hood were
announced, they found her quite prepared.</p>

<p>Touched, and reassured at the ex-maid’s
appearance, the Queen judged, at last, it
was safe to unbend. Already very remote
and unworldly in her novice’s dress, she
had ceased, indeed, to be a being there was
need any more to either circumvent,
humour, or suppress; and now that the
threatened danger was gone, her Majesty
glanced, half-lachrymosely, about among
her personal belongings for some slight
token of “esteem” or <i>souvenir</i>. Skimming
from cabinet to cabinet, in a sort of hectic
dance, she began to fear, as she passed her
bibelots in review, that beyond a Chinese
Buddha that she believed to be ill-omened,
and which for a nun seemed hardly suitable,
she could spare nothing about her after all,
and in some dilemma, she raised her eyes,
as though for a crucifix, towards the wall.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
Above the long-chair a sombre study of a
strangled negress in a ditch by Gauguin
conjured up to-day with poignant force a
vivid vision of the Tropics.</p>

<p>“The poor Duchess!” she involuntarily
sighed, going off into a train of speculation
of her own.</p>

<p>Too tongue-tied, or, perhaps, too discreet,
to inform the Queen that anything she might
select would immediately be confiscated by
the Abbess, Sister Irene, while professing
her rosary, appraised her surroundings with
furtive eyes, crossing herself frequently with
a speed, and facility due to practice whenever
her glance chanced to alight on some
nude shape in stone. Keen, meagre, and
perhaps slightly malicious, hers was a
curiously pinched face&mdash;like a cold violet.</p>

<p>“The Abbess is still in retreat; but sends
her duty,” she ventured as the Queen
approached a gueridon near which she was
standing.</p>

<p>“Indeed? How I envy her,” the Queen
wistfully said, selecting, as suited to the
requirements of the occasion, a little volume
of a mystic trend, the <i>Cries of Love</i> of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
Father Surin,<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> bound in grey velvet, which
she pressed upon the reluctant novice,
with a brief, but cordial, kiss of farewell.</p>

<p>“She looked quite pretty!” she exclaimed,
sinking to the long-chair as soon
as the nuns had gone.</p>

<p>“So like the Cimabue in the long
corridor ...” the Countess of Tolga
murmured chillily; It was her present
policy that her adored ally, Olga Blumenghast,
should benefit by Mademoiselle de
Nazianzi’s retirement from Court, by becoming
nearer to the Queen, when they
would work all the wires between them.</p>

<p>“I’d have willingly followed her,” the
Queen weariedly declared, “at any rate,
until after the wedding.”</p>

<p>“It seems that I and Lord Derbyfield
are to share the same closed carriage in the
wake of the bridal coach,” the Countess of
Tolga said, considering with a supercilious air
her rose <i>su&egrave;de</i> slipper on the dark carpet.</p>

<p>“He’s like some great Bull. What do
you suppose he talks about?”</p>

<p>The Countess d’Omptyda repressed a
giggle.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span></p>

<p>“They tell me Don Juan was nothing
<i>nothing</i> to him.... He cannot see, he
cannot be, oh every hour. It seems he
can’t help it, and that he simply <i>has</i> to!”</p>

<p>“Fortunately Lady Lavinia Lee-Strange
will be in the landau as well!”</p>

<p>The Queen laid her cheek to her hands.</p>

<p>“I all but died, dear Violet,” she
crooned, “listening to an account of her
Ancestor, who fell, fighting Scotland, at
the battle of Pinkie Cleugh.”</p>

<p>“These well-bred, but detestably insular
women, how they bore one.”</p>

<p>“They are not to be appraised by any
ordinary standards. Crossing the state saloon
while coming here what should I see, ma’am,
but Lady Canon of Noon on her hands and
knees (all fours!) peeping below the loose-covers
of the chairs in order to examine the
Gobelins-tapestries beneath....”</p>

<p>“Oh&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“‘Absolutely authentic’ I said! as I
passed on, leaving her looking like a pick-pocket
caught in the act.”</p>

<p>“I suppose she was told to make a quiet
survey....”</p>

<p>“Like their beagles and deer-hounds,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
that their Landseer so loved to paint, I fear
the British character is, at bottom, <i>nothing</i>
if not rapacious!”</p>

<p>“It’s said, I believe, to behold the
Englishman at his <i>best</i>, one should watch
him play at tip-and-run.”</p>

<p>“You mean of course at cricket?”</p>

<p>The Queen looked doubtful: She had retained
of a cricket-match at Lord’s a memory
of hatless giants waving wooden sticks.</p>

<p>“I only wish it could have been a long
engagement,” she abstrusely murmured,
fastening her attention on the fountains
whitely spurting in the gardens below.</p>

<p>Valets in cotton-jackets and light blue
aprons bearing baskets of crockery and
<i>argenterie</i>, were making ready beneath the
tall Tuba trees, a supper <i>buffet</i> for the
evening’s Ball.</p>

<p>A lad’s fresh voice, sweet as a robin’s,
came piping up.</p>

<p>“These wretched workpeople&mdash;&mdash;!
There’s not a peaceful corner,” the Queen
complained, as her husband’s shape
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
appeared at the door. He was followed by
his first secretary&mdash;a simple commoner,
yet, with the air, and manner, peculiar to
the husband of a Countess.</p>

<p>“Yes, Willie? I’ve a hundred head-aches.
What is it?”</p>

<p>“Both King Geo and Queen Glory, are
wondering where you are.”</p>

<p>“Oh, really, Willie?”</p>

<p>“And dear Elsie’s asking after you too.”</p>

<p>“Very likely,” the Queen returned with
quiet complaisance, “but unfortunately, I
have neither her energy, or,” she murmured
with a slightly sardonic laugh, “her
appetite!”</p>

<p>The Countess of Tolga tittered.</p>

<p>“She called for fried-eggs and butcher’s-meat,
this morning, about the quarter
before eight,” she averred.</p>

<p>“An excellent augury for our dynasty,”
the King declared, reposing the eyes of
an adoring grandparent upon an alabaster
head of a Boy attributed to Donatello.</p>

<p>“She’s terribly foreign, Willie...!
Imagine ham and eggs ...” the Queen
dropped her face to her hand.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span></p>

<p>“So long as the Royal-House&mdash;&mdash;” The
King broke off, turning gallantly to raise the
Countess d’Omptyda, who had sunk with
a gesture of exquisite allegiance to the floor.</p>

<p>“Sir ... Sir!” she faltered in confusion,
seeking with fervent lips her
Sovereign’s hand.</p>

<p>“What is she doing, Willie?”</p>

<p>“Begging for Strawberry-leaves!” the
Countess of Tolga brilliantly commented.</p>

<p>“Apropos of Honours ... it appears
King Geo has signified his intention of
raising his present representative in
Pisuerga to the peerage.”</p>

<p>“After her recent <i>Cause</i>, Lady Something
should be not a little consoled.”</p>

<p>“She was at the d&eacute;but of the new diva,
little Miss Hellvellyn (the foreign invasion
has indeed begun!), at the Opera-House
last night, so radiant....”</p>

<p>“When she cranes forward out of her
own box to smile at someone into the next,
I can’t explain ... but one feels she ought
to hatch,” the Queen murmured, repairing
capriciously from one couch to another.</p>

<p>“We neglect our guests, my dear,” the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
King expostulatingly exclaimed, bending
over his consort anxiously from behind.</p>

<p>“Tell me, Willie,” she cooed, caressing
the medals upon his breast, and drawing
him gently down: “tell me? Didst thou
enjoy thy cigar, dear, with King Geo?”</p>

<p>“I can recall in my time, Child, a suaver
flavour....”</p>

<p>“Thy little chat, though, dearest, was
well enough?”</p>

<p>“I would not call him crafty, but I
should say he was a man of considerable
subtlety ...” the King evasively replied.</p>

<p>“One does not need, my dearest
nectarine, a prodigy of intelligence however
to take him in!”</p>

<p>“Before the proposed Loan, love, can be
brought about, he may wish to question
thee as to thy political opinions.”</p>

<p>The Queen gave a little light laugh.</p>

<p>“No one knows what my political
opinions are; I don’t myself!”</p>

<p>“And I’m quite confident of it: But,
indeed, my dear, we neglect our functions.”</p>

<p>“I only wish it could have been a <i>long</i>
engagement, Willie....”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span></p>

<p class="drop"><span class="uppercase">In</span> the cloister eaves, the birds were
just awakening, and all the spider
scales, in the gargoyled gables,
glanced fresh with dew. Above the Piet&agrave;,
on the porter’s gate, slow-speeding clouds,
like knots of pink roses, came blowing across
the sky, sailing away in titanic bouquets
towards the clear horizon. All virginal in
the early sunrise what enchantment the
world possessed! The rhythmic sway-sway
of the trees, the exhalations of the flowers,
the ethereal candour of this early hour,&mdash;these
raised the heart up to their Creator.</p>

<p>Kneeling at the casement of a postulant’s
cell, Laura de Nazianzi recalled that serene,
and just thus had she often planned must
dawn her bridal day!</p>

<p>Beyond the cruciform flower-beds, and
the cloister wall, soared the Blue Jesus,
the storied windows of its lofty galleries
aglow with light.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span></p>

<p>“Most gracious Jesus. Help me to
forget. For my heart aches. Uphold me
now.”</p>

<p>But to forget to-day, was well-nigh she
knew impossible....</p>

<p>Once it seemed she caught the sound of
splendid music from the direction of the
Park, but it was too early for music yet.
Away in the palace, the Princess Elsie
must be already astir ... in her peignoir,
perhaps? The bridal-garment unfolded
upon the bed: But no; it was said the
bed indeed was where usually her Royal-Highness’
dogs....</p>

<p>With a long and very involuntary sigh,
she began to sweep, and put in some order,
her room.</p>

<p>How forlorn her cornette looked upon
her <i>prie-Dieu</i>! And, oh, how stern, and
“old”!</p>

<p>Would an impulse to bend it slightly
but only so, <i>so</i> slightly, to an angle to suit
her face, be attended, later, by remorse?</p>

<p>“Confiteor Deo omnipotenti, beatae
Mariae semper vergini, beato Michaeli
Archangelo (et <i>tibi</i> Pater), quia peccavi
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
nimis cogitatione, verbo et opere,” she
entreated, reposing her chin in meditation,
upon the handle of her broom.</p>

<p>The bluish shadow of a cypress-tree, on
the empty wall, fascinated her as few
pictures had.</p>

<p>“Grant my soul Eyes,” she prayed,
cheerfully completing her task.</p>

<p>In the corridor, being a general holiday,
all was yet quite still. A sound, as of
gentle snoring, came indeed from behind
more than one closed door, and the new
<i>pensionnaire</i> was preparing to beat a
retreat, when she perceived, in the cloister,
the dumpish form of Old Jane.</p>

<p>Seated in the sun by the convent well,
the Porteress was sharing a scrap of breakfast
with the birds.</p>

<p>“You’re soonish for Mass, love,” she
broke out, her large archaic features surcharged
with smiles.</p>

<p>“It’s such a perfect morning, I felt I
must come down.”</p>

<p>“I’ve seen many a more promising sunrise
before now, my dear, turn to storm
and blast! An orange sky overhead,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
brings back to me the morning that I was
received; ah, I shall never forget, as I
was taking my Vows, a flash of forked
lightning, and a clap of Thunder (Glory
be to God!) followed by a water-spout
(Mercy save us!) bursting all over my
Frinch lace veil....”</p>

<p>“What is your book, Old Jane?”</p>

<p>“Something light, love, as it’s a holiday.”</p>

<p>“<i>Pascal</i>....”</p>

<p>“Though it’s mostly a <i>F&ecirc;te</i> day I’ve
extra to do!” the Porteress averred,
dropping her eyes to the great, glistening
spits, upon the Cloister flags. It was her
boast she could distinguish Monsignor
Potts’ round splash from Father Geordie
Picpus’ more dapper fine one, and again
the Abbess’ from Mother Martinez de la
Rosa’s&mdash;although these indeed shared a
certain opaque sameness.</p>

<p>“Of course it’s a day for private visits.”</p>

<p>“Since the affair of Sister Dorothea and
Brother Bernard Soult, private visits are
no longer allowed,” the Porteress returned,
reproving modestly, with the cord of her
discipline, a pert little lizard, that seemed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
to be proposing to penetrate between the
nude toes of her sandalled foot.</p>

<p>But on such a radiant morning it was
preposterous to hint at “Rules.”</p>

<p>Beneath the clement sun a thousand
cicadas were insouciantly chirping, while
birds, skimming about without thoughts
of money, floated lightly from tree to tree.</p>

<p>“Jesus&mdash;Mary&mdash;Joseph!” the Porteress
purred, as a Nun, with her face all muffled
up in wool, crossed the Cloister, glancing
neither to right nor left, and sharply
slammed a door: for, already, the Convent
was beginning to give signs of animation.
Deep in a book of Our Lady’s Hours, a
biretta’d priest was slowly rounding a
garden path, while repairing from a <i>Grotto-sepulchre</i>,
to which was attached a handsome
indulgence, Mother Martinez de la
Rosa appeared, all heavily leaning on her
stick.</p>

<p>Simultaneously the matins bell rang out,
calling all to prayer.</p>

<p>The Convent Chapel founded by the
tender enthusiasm of a wealthy widow,
the Countess d’Acunha, to perpetuate her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
earthly comradeship with the beautiful
Andalusian, the Do&ntilde;a Dolores Baatz, was
still but thinly peopled some few minutes
later, although the warning bell had stopped.</p>

<p>Peering around, Laura was disappointed
not to remark Sister Ursula in her habitual
place, between the veiled fresco of the
“Circumcision” and the stoup of holy-water
by the door.</p>

<p>Beyond an offer to “exchange whippings”
there had been a certain coolness in
the greeting with her friend, that had both
surprised and pained her.</p>

<p>“When those we rely on wound and
betray us, to whom should we turn but
Thee?” she breathed, addressing a crucifix,
in ivory, contrived by love, that was a
miracle of wonder.</p>

<p>Finished Mass, there was a general rush
for the Refectory!</p>

<p>Preceded by Sister Clothilde, and followed,
helter-skelter, by an exuberant bevy
of nuns, even Mother Martinez, who being
shortsighted would go feeling the ground
with her cane, was propelled to the measure
of a hop-and-skip.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span></p>

<p>Passing beneath an archway, labelled
“Silence” (the injunction to-day being
undoubtedly ignored), the company was
welcomed by the mingled odours of tea,
<i>consomm&eacute;</i>, and fruit. It was a custom of
the Convent for one of the Sisters during
meal-time to read aloud from some standard
work of fideism, and these edifying recitations,
interspersed by such whispered
questions as: “Tea, or <i>Consomm&eacute;</i>?”
“A Banana, or a Pomegranate?” gave to
those at all foolishly, or hysterically inclined,
a painful desire to giggle. Mounting
the pulpit-lectern, a nun with an aristocratic,
though gourmand little face, was
about to resume the arid life of the Byzantine
monk, Basilius Saturninus, when
Mother Martinez de la Rosa took it upon
herself, in a few patriotic words, to relax
all rules for that day.</p>

<p>“We understand in the world now,” a
little faded woman murmured to Laura upon
her right: “that the latest craze among
ladies is to gild their tongues; but I should
be afraid,” she added diffidently, dipping her
banana into her tea, “of poison, myself!”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span></p>

<p>Unhappy at her friend’s absence from
the Refectory, Laura, however, was in no
mood to entertain the nuns with stories of
the present pagan tendencies of society.</p>

<p>Through the bare, blindless windows,
framing a sky so bluely luminous, came
the swelling clamour of the assembling
crowds, tinging the languid air as with
some sultry fever. From the <i>Chaus&eacute;e</i>,
music of an extraordinary intention&mdash;heated
music, crude music, played with
passionate &eacute;lan to perfect time, conjured
up, with vivid, heartrending prosaicness,
the seething Boulevards beyond the high
old creeper-covered walls.</p>

<p>“I forget now, Mother, which of the
Queens it is that will wear a velvet train of
a beautiful orchid shade: But one of them
will!” Sister Irene of the Incarnation was
holding forth.</p>

<p>“I must confess,” Mother Martinez remarked,
who was peeling herself a peach,
with an air of far attention: “I must
confess, I should have liked to have cast
my eye upon the <i>lingerie</i>....”</p>

<p>“I would rather have seen the ballwraps,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
Mother, or the shoes, and evening
slippers!”</p>

<p>“Yes, or the fabulous jewels....”</p>

<p>“Of course Sister Laura saw the <i>trousseau</i>?”</p>

<p>But Laura made feint not to hear.</p>

<p>Discipline relaxed, a number of nuns
had collected provisions and were picnicking
in the window, where Sister Innez (an
ex-Repertoire actress) was giving some
spirited renderings of her chief successful
parts&mdash;<i>Jane de Simerose</i>, <i>Frou-Frou</i>,
<i>Sappho</i>, <i>Cigarette</i>....</p>

<p>“My darling child! I always sleep all
day and only revive when there’s <i>a Man</i>,”
she was saying with an impudent look,
sending the scandalised Sisters into delighted
convulsions.</p>

<p>Unable to endure it any longer, Laura
crept away.</p>

<p>A desire for air and solitude, led her
towards the Recreation ground. After
the hot refectory, sauntering in the silken
shade of the old astounding cedars, was
delightful quite. In the deserted alleys,
the golden blossoms of the censia-trees,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
unable to resist the sun, littered in perfumed
piles the ground, overcoming her before
long with a sensation akin to <i>vertige</i>.
Anxious to find her friend, Laura turned
towards her cell.</p>

<p>She found Sister Ursula leaning on her
window-ledge all crouched up&mdash;like a
Duchess on “a First Night.”</p>

<p>“My dear, my dear, the <i>crowds</i>!”</p>

<p>“Ursula?”</p>

<p>“Yes, what is it?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I’ll go, since I’m in the way.”</p>

<p>“Touchy Goose,” Sister Ursula murmured
wheeling round with a glance of
complex sweetness.</p>

<p>“Ah, Ursula,” Laura sighed, smiling
reproachfully at her friend.</p>

<p>She had long almond eyes, one longer
and larger than the other, that gave to her
narrow, etiolated face, an exalted, mystic
air. Her hair, wholly concealed by her
full coif, would be inclined to rich copper
or chestnut: Indeed, below the pinched
and sensitive nostrils, a moustache (so
slight as to be scarcely discernible) proved
this beyond all controversy to be so. But
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
perhaps the quality and beauty of her
hands were her chief distinction.</p>

<p>“Do you believe it would cause an
earthquake, if we climbed out, dear little
one, upon the leads?” she asked.</p>

<p>“I had forgotten you overlooked the
street by leaning out,” Laura answered,
sinking fatigued to a little cane armchair.</p>

<p>“Listen, Laura...!”</p>

<p>“This cheering racks my heart....”</p>

<p>“Ah, Astaroth! There went a very
‘swell’ carriage.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps I’ll come back later: It’s
less noisy in my cell.”</p>

<p>“Now you’re here, I shall ask you, I
think, to whip me.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no....”</p>

<p>“Bad dear Little-One. Dear meek soul,”
Sister Ursula softly laughed.</p>

<p>“This maddening cheering,” Laura
breathed, rolling tormented eyes about her.</p>

<p>A crucifix, a text: <i>I would lay Pansies
at Jesus’ Feet</i>, two fresh eggs in a blue paper
bag, some ends of string, a breviary, and
a birch, were the chamber’s individual, if
meagre, contents.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span></p>

<p>“You used <i>not</i> to have that text, Ursula,”
Laura observed, her attention arrested by
the preparation of a Cinematograph Company
on the parapet of the Cathedral.</p>

<p>The Church had much need indeed of
Reformation! The Times were incredibly
low: A new crusade ... she ruminated,
revolted at the sight of an old man holding
dizzily to a stone-winged angel, with
a wine-flask at his lips.</p>

<p>“Come, dear, won’t you assist me now
to mortify my senses?” Sister Ursula
cajoled.</p>

<p>“No, really, no&mdash;!&mdash;!&mdash;!”</p>

<p>“Quite lightly: For I was scourged, by
Sister Agnes, but yesterday, with a heavy
bunch of keys, head downwards, hanging
from a bar.”</p>

<p>“Oh....”</p>

<p>“This morning she sent me those pullets’
eggs. I perfectly was touched by her
delicate sweet sympathy.”</p>

<p>Laura gasped.</p>

<p>“It must have hurt you?”</p>

<p>“I assure you I felt nothing&mdash;my spirit
had travelled so far,” Sister Ursula replied,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
turning to throw an interested glance at
the street.</p>

<p>It was close now upon the critical
hour, and the plaudits of the crowd were
becoming more and more uproarious, as
“favourites” in Public life, and “celebrities”
of all sorts, began to arrive in brisk succession
at the allotted door of the Cathedral.</p>

<p>“I could almost envy the fleas in the
Cardinal’s vestments,” Sister Ursula declared,
overcome by the venal desire to see.</p>

<p>Gazing at the friend upon whom she had
counted in some disillusion, Laura quietly
left her.</p>

<p>The impulse to witness something of
the spectacle outside was, nevertheless,
infectious, and recollecting that from the
grotto-sepulchre in the garden it was not
impossible to attain the convent wall, she
determined, moved by some wayward
instinct, to do so. Frequently, as a child,
had she scaled it, to survey the doings of
the city streets beyond&mdash;the streets, named
by the nuns often “Sinward-ho.” Crossing
the cloisters, and through old gates crowned
by vast fruit-baskets in stone, she followed,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
feverishly the ivy-masked bricks of the
sheltering wall, and was relieved to reach
the grotto without encountering anyone.
Surrounded by heavy boskage, it marked
a spot where, once, long ago, one of the
Sisters, it was said, had received the
mystic stigmata.... With a feline effort
(her feet supported by the Grotto boulders),
it needed but a bound to attain an incomparable
post of vantage.</p>

<p>Beneath a blaze of bunting, the street
seemed paved with heads. “Madonna,”
she breathed, as an official on a white
horse, its mane stained black, began
authoritatively backing his steed into the
patient faces of the mob, startling an infant
in arms below, to a frantic fit of squalls.</p>

<p>“Just so shall we stand on the Day of
Judgment,” she reflected, blinking at the
glare.</p>

<p>Street boys vending programmes,
‘Lucky’ horseshoes, Saturnalian emblems&mdash;(these
for gentlemen only), offering postcards
of ‘Geo and Glory,’ etc., wedged their
way however where it might have been
deemed indeed impossible for anyone to pass.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span></p>

<p>And <i>he</i>, she wondered, her eyes following
the wheeling pigeons, alarmed by the
recurrent salutes of the signal guns, he
must be there already: Under the dome!
Restive a little beneath the busy scrutiny,
his tongue like the point of a blade....</p>

<p>A burst of cheering seemed to announce
the Queen. But no, it was only a lady,
with a parasol sewn with diamonds, that
was exciting the rah-rahs of the crowd.
Followed by mingled cries of “Shame!”
“Waste!” and sighs of envy, Madame
Wetme was enjoying a belated triumph.
And now a brief lull, as a brake containing
various delegates and “representatives of
English Culture,” rolled by at a stately
trot&mdash;Lady Alexander, E. V. Lucas, Robert
Hichens, Clutton Brock, etc.,&mdash;the ensemble
the very apotheosis of worn-out <i>clich&eacute;</i>.</p>

<p>“There’s someone there wot’s got enough
heron plumes on her head!” a young girl
in the crowd remarked.</p>

<p>And nobody contradicted her.</p>

<p>Then troops and outriders, and at last
the Queen.</p>

<p>She was looking charming in a Corinthian
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
chlamyde, in a carriage lined in deep
delphinium blue, behind six restive blue
roan horses.</p>

<p>Finally, the bride and her father, bowing
this way and that....</p>

<p>Cheers.</p>

<p>“Huzzas”&mdash;</p>

<p>A hushed suspense.</p>

<p>Below the wall the voice of a beggar
arose, persistent, haunting: “For the Love
of God.... In the Name of Pity ... of
Pity.”</p>

<p>“Of Pity,” she echoed, addressing a
frail, wind-sown harebell, blue as the sky:
And leaning upon the shattered glass
ends, that crowned the wall, she fell to considering
the future&mdash;Obedience, Solitude&mdash;death.</p>

<p>The troubling <i>valse</i> theme from <i>Dante in
Paris</i> interrupted her meditations.</p>

<p>How often had they valsed it together,
he and she ... sometimes as a two-step...!
What souvenirs.... Yousef,
Yousef.... Above the Cathedral, the
crumbling clouds, had eclipsed the sun.
In the intense meridian glare the thronged
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
street seemed even as though half-hypnotised;
occasionally only the angle of a
parasol would change, or some bored
soldier’s legs would give a little. When
brusquely, from the belfry, burst a
triumphant clash of bells.</p>

<p>Laura caught her breath.</p>

<p>Already?</p>

<p>A shaking of countless handkerchiefs in
wild ovation: From roof-tops, and balconies,
the air was thick with falling flowers&mdash;the
bridal pair!</p>

<p>But only for the bridegroom had she eyes.</p>

<p>Oblivious of what she did, she began to
beat her hands, until they streamed with
blood, against the broken glass ends upon
the wall: “Yousef, Yousef, Yousef....”</p>

<p>“But Mr Firbank has talents&mdash;a gift of style,
a capacity to write dialogue, an appreciation
of the beautiful and the absurd. With such
gifts he might produce a real comedy of
manners. It is to be hoped that he will.”

<h3>LIVERPOOL POST AND MERCURY:</h3>

<p>“In taking to play-writing he has obviously
done the right thing. <i>The Princess Zoubaroff</i>
is artificial comedy of the uncommonly successful
sort.... The brilliancy, suavity and vim
of the dialogue.... No present-day social-satirist
has parodied more cruelly the elegant
verbal affectations, the malicious chatter and
fashionable slang that passes for wit and
wisdom in Mayfair.”</p>

<h3>SPECTATOR:</h3>

<p>“Mr Firbank has an extraordinary knack of
writing dialogue, and his entirely odious
people move and breathe and are completely
real. Perhaps some day Mr Firbank will give
us a comedy that is not all satire; when he
does it might prove an exceedingly brilliant
acting play.”</p>

<h3>OBSERVER:</h3>

<p>“Mr Firbank always had a sense of style and
a feeling for the mannered beauty of arranged
words.... In <i>Santal</i> the passion for beautiful
writing is still evident, but it is used with
greater simplicity to achieve an effect such as a
more reticent Pierre Loti might manage....
Mr Firbank has emotion rather than passion,
and his East is viewed through a slight haze
of sentiment; but it is a real country, and has
its own spiritual excitements.”</p>

<h3>GLASGOW EVENING NEWS:</h3>

<p>“Mr Firbank has acquired a reputation as a
stylist which this work will enhance. Within
its brief compass there is all the glamour, the
colour, the heat, the smells, the vileness,
the beauty, and the fervour of Islam. It is the
sort of thing that Loti does on a grander scale,
and, like Loti, Mr Firbank is an adept at the
creation of atmosphere. He is guilty of a
few affectations perhaps, but these are like
precious flaws in a wondrous Turkish carpet&mdash;they
are lost in the beauty of the design as
a whole.”</p>

<h3>LIVERPOOL DAILY POST:</h3>

<p>“Mr Ronald Firbank has always had his own
manner, and a very modish one. In <i>Santal</i>
the elegance, almost dandyism, of his style
has given just a faint hint of flippancy to a
tale in itself very dignified, and full of an unexpected
warmth and delicacy of feeling. It
is a <i>nouvelle</i>&mdash;who could call a thing of such
distinction a long short story?&mdash;with the vivid
richly-coloured background of the East....
Something there is, too, of irony and detachment,
as though the Mr Firbank of <i>Valmouth</i>
and of <i>The Princess Zoubaroff</i> were secretly
smiling a little cynically at his unexpected
tumble into sentiment.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span></p>

<h3>SOUTHPORT GUARDIAN:</h3>

<p>“The incense of Santal pervades the book
throughout. Mr Firbank is a discriminating
artist; he has an exotic sense of words and of
colour. Seldom have we met in so short a
space so intense a characterisation of pilgrimage
or so vivid a picture of the Algerian
scene.”</p>

<h3>TIMES:</h3>

<p>“Mr Firbank here drops his artificiality and
gives a vividly real study of an Eastern city
... a vivid glimpse of a world strange&mdash;to
a European&mdash;but convincingly true.”</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your

1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
